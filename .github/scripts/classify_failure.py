"""Classify a nightly failure summary as an external-dependency error or not.

Nightly issue-filing runs auto-bisection to blame the PR that introduced a
regression. That only makes sense when the failure is caused by a code change in
*this* repo. Failures caused by the environment -- a busy/unhealthy GPU, a driver
mismatch, a broken LLVM/toolchain download, a network/proxy hiccup, a full disk --
are NOT anyone's PR, so we skip bisection and annotate the issue instead.

The classifier is intentionally conservative: it only flags a failure as external
when a known infra signature matches, and it explicitly does NOT flag
compiler/runtime resource errors (e.g. ``OutOfResources: shared memory``) or
assertion failures, which are real regressions that bisection should chase.
