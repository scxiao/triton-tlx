"""Standalone **PTX** reduction-equivalence signature — an independent layout-equivalence
checker at the PTX level (M1-PTX).

This is **not** a backstop layered after the TTGIR checker; it is a peer "choice of check
level" that reconstructs the floating-point reduction *tree* directly from PTX and labels
each leaf with the tensor element it reads (the PTX echo of the thread<->data map). Two
configs are bitwise-equivalent reductions iff their reconstructed trees are structurally
equal — which captures, from PTX alone:

  * the **layout** — which element each thread/lane/register holds, recovered from the
    load-address arithmetic (``bitequiv.ptx.affine``); different ``num_warps`` /
    ``sizePerThread`` / transpose => different leaf coordinates;
  * the **within-thread fold order** — the def-use chain of the scalar combine ops
    (left-fold vs balanced tree), not just an opcode multiset;
  * the **within-/cross-warp tree** — the butterfly ``shfl.sync.bfly`` steps and the
    shared-memory exchanges;
  * the **rounding / FMA-contraction** decision — ``fma.rn.f32`` vs ``mul``+``add``,
    ``.rn``/``.ftz`` — carried verbatim in each tree node's modifiers.

The PTX is parsed structurally with ``pyptx`` (a real PTX parser, pure-Python). The
engine lives in :mod:`bitequiv.ptx` (``linker`` -> ``affine`` -> ``leaves`` -> ``builder``).

**Soundness — what it does and does NOT guarantee.** This is not an absolute proof that
two configs are bit-identical. It is **sound only relative to the reconstructed
result-DAG at PTX**: it walks back from each result store through the value graph and turns
every op it does not model into a *verbatim* OPAQUE node, so a difference it *can see* in
that graph forces a split. It does not over-merge on the modeled dimensions (layout,
association order, rounding, fusion) or on a syntactically-different unmodeled op on the
path. "Equal signature => equal bits" therefore holds only **under these conditions**:

  * the backward walk reaches every op that affects the output (control flow / predicate
    conditions it cannot follow are a gap);
  * opaque tokens never collide across the two modules compared (a lost-provenance leaf
    that falls back to a register name is a known collision risk);
  * each canonicalization is bit-preserving (today only commutative ``add``/``mul`` operand
    sorting + ``fma``'s multiply pair, which are IEEE-safe);
  * the two kernels are identical outside the captured computation (true when autotuning a
    single kernel) and you accept the **PTX -> SASS residual** (``ptxas`` can still
    reorder/contract below PTX; real ground truth is SASS / the runtime bits).

So it is a cheap static **pre-filter**, not a proof — the runtime bit-comparison
(``bitequiv/evaluation``) is the ground truth. Within those conditions it is conservative
(it over-splits, costing tuning freedom, rather than over-merging). The thread-count
(``.reqntid``) and a tensor-core (``mma``) guard are folded into each entry's signature so
different launch geometries or un-modeled accumulations never collapse to an empty match.

**Residual caveat.** PTX sits above the ``ptxas`` -> SASS gap; ``ptxas`` can still
contract/reorder. PTX is the practical check, not absolute ground truth (SASS via
``cuobjdump`` would be); ``--fmad=false`` pins the fusion decision. See ``design-doc.md``.
