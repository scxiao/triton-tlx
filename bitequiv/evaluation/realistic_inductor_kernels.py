"""Realistic TorchInductor kernel corpus — diversity + reduction-equivalence gap analysis.

These are not synthetic test kernels like the ones in ``eval_kernels.py``. Every kernel here
is a **real Triton kernel that torch.compile / TorchInductor emits** — collected to answer two
questions at once:
  1. GAP ANALYSIS (the original 8, GROUP 1): "how far is the shipped reduction-equivalence
     checker from what a real customer actually ships?"
  2. DIVERSITY / BREADTH (GROUPS 2+): "across the whole ZOO of kernel TYPES a real PyTorch
     workload produces — GEMM, warp-specialized, attention, scan, cooperative reduction,
     pointwise/foreach — where does bitwise-equivalence work apply, and where is it out of
     scope (an M3 / future target)?" This makes the corpus concrete evidence of how much the
     project can contribute to real Triton kernels, not just reductions.

    ⚠️  This module is mainly a REFERENCE corpus, NOT wired into ``evaluate.py``: GROUPS 2+ are
        inspected, never compiled (they hard-code shapes and reference Inductor helpers). Treat
        those as "realistic customer usage → target", not an in-scope requirement — each future
        checker improvement can be measured against them. The EXCEPTION is GROUP 1 (A..H): its
        six ordered add-reductions are made RUNNABLE (an ``ORD`` reduction_ordering param) and
        have a self-contained M2 harness at the bottom of the file (this is where the former
        ``complex_fusion_eval.py`` experiment was merged, to avoid a duplicate kernel copy).

How these kernels were collected (reproducible)
-----------------------------------------------
Two ways, recorded per kernel in its banner:
  * HARVEST — copied verbatim from Inductor's own in-tree tests (e.g. ``test_cuda_repro.py``,
    ``test_static_triton_launcher.py`` under ``caffe2/test/inductor/``).
  * GENERATE — emitted by running a tiny ``torch.compile`` snippet under
    ``TORCH_LOGS=output_code`` on an **H100 (sm_90)** and copying the kernel out of the
    inductor cache. GEMM used ``config.max_autotune_gemm_backends="TRITON"``; the split-scan,
    cooperative reduction, and combo/foreach kernels used the matching config knob. Generation
    RAN each kernel (so GROUP 2..7 Hopper kernels are verified runnable + numerically correct).
Faithfulness rule (as with the original 8): body copied verbatim; the trailing async-compile
wrapper stripped; the Inductor ``@triton_heuristics.<cat>(...)`` decorator replaced with a
plain ``@triton.jit`` and its autotune config kept as a ``# Autotune:`` comment in the banner.
The one exception is the Blackwell WS kernel (GROUP 3): it is TEMPLATE-DERIVED (rendered from
the Inductor jinja template) and NOT runnable on this sm_90 host — it needs sm_100/Blackwell.

GPU-architecture note (does the .py source differ per GPU?)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Mostly NO. TorchInductor emits ONE arch-agnostic ``@triton.jit`` body; the GPU shows up only as
(a) autotune configs (num_warps / num_stages / num_consumer_groups / warp_specialize /
epilogue_subtile), (b) capability guards, and (c) the wgmma-vs-tcgen05 MMA choice the compiler
makes below the source. Source-level arch divergence appears ONLY in low-level warp-specialized
kernels — hence GROUP 3 carries the one genuinely arch-specific body (Blackwell device-TMA +
``warp_specialize=True`` + tcgen05 accumulator path) next to the arch-agnostic Hopper GEMMs.

How the scope verdicts were produced
------------------------------------
Each kernel was checked against the two shipped checkers by reading their source
(``bitequiv/ptx_reduction.py`` + engine ``bitequiv/ptx/``, and ``bitequiv/ttgir_reduction.py``
+ ``lib/Analysis/ReductionOrder.cpp``), and the verdict was adversarially re-verified. Recall
what each checker does:
  * **PTX checker** — reconstructs the FP reduction TREE from PTX: roots = ``st.global``
    values, leaves = ``ld.global`` loads labelled by AFFINE load-address arithmetic; the
    num_warps/layout-invariant "collapse" (``ITreeReduce``) fires only for a SINGLE-output,
    fully-affine, BALANCED **add** tree (``_REDUCE_FP == {add}``). Everything else stays a
    verbatim, sound-but-layout-bearing tree (it over-splits, never over-merges). ``tl.dot`` /
    wgmma / tcgen05 are NOT modeled — they are fingerprinted as an opaque ``unanalyzed-mma``.
  * **TTGIR checker** — one signature per ``tt.reduce`` from ``toLinearLayout`` + the combine
    region's op-name sequence. FMA-contraction-blind; ``tt.dot``/mma get only an
    ``unanalyzed-mma`` guard key; and it NEVER walks ``tt.scan``, ``tt.load``, addresses, a
    loop-carried accumulate, or value provenance.

Inline scope tags (the "out of which checker's scope?" flag the corpus is for)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [scope: PTX]     — essential syntax the PTX tree-checker cannot model / degrades on
    [scope: TTGIR]   — essential syntax the TTGIR layout-checker cannot model / degrades on
    [scope: BOTH]    — out of scope for both checkers
    [scope: neither] — handled SOUNDLY by both (flagged only to pre-empt "surely this breaks it")
severity in parentheses:
    (SOUNDNESS GAP)      — the checker can return a WRONG "equivalent" (over-merge). The scan /
                           split-scan kernels hit this. This is the dangerous class.
    (sound; over-splits) — never wrong; the checker just refuses the num_warps-invariant merge,
                           so it loses tuning freedom. The open work is PRECISION, not soundness.
    (out — M3/scan)      — deliberately not modeled by a REDUCTION checker (MMA is the M3 target;
                           scan is the scan-model target). Sound today (over-splits), no gap.

=========================================================================================
GROUP 1 — reduction fusions (the original gap-analysis 8). TTGIR / PTX / overall scope.
=========================================================================================
  KERNEL                     TTGIR   PTX     OVERALL WHY NOT FULLY SUPPORTED YET
  -------------------------  ------  ------  ------  ----------------------------------------
  A_rms_norm_fwd             in      partial partial PTX: the one reduction result fans out to 2 st.global roots, so the
                                                     num_warps-invariant collapse is refused (sound; over-splits).
  B_layernorm_welford_gather partial partial partial PTX: data-dependent GATHER load -> opaque leaf (provenance lost);
                                                     welford combine is FMA-blind on BOTH (structural only); 6 roots.
  C_rms_norm_bwd_2reduce     in      partial partial no soundness gap. PTX over-splits (3 roots + non-layout-invariant
                                                     leaves); TTGIR emits 2 positional sigs (sound).
  D_masked_global_sum        in      partial partial PTX: tl.where tail-mask -> selp INSIDE the leaf, so the maximal
                                                     balanced region will not collapse (sound; over-splits).
  E_triu_masked_rowsum       in      partial partial PTX: multi-output per-row (roots>1) -> collapse refused
                                                     (sound; over-splits).
  F_cumsum_scan              out     out     NEITHER *** SOUNDNESS GAP *** tt.scan not modeled: TTGIR emits () and may
                                                     OVER-MERGE; PTX keeps the scan verbatim/opaque. int64, not FP.
  G_plain_sum_looped         in      partial partial TTGIR: loop accumulate is not a tt.reduce (safe only via sAxis
                                                     over-split). PTX: collapse gated by _balance_pass (R0_BLOCK<128).
  H_mean_permute             in      partial partial PTX: multi-output per-row at XBLOCK>1 -> collapse refused (sound).
                                                     NB the "permute"/mean-divide live in OTHER ops, not this body.

GROUPS 2+ — diverse realistic kernel TYPES (breadth). Verdicts are per the reduction checkers.
=========================================================================================
  KERNEL                     TTGIR   PTX     OVERALL WHAT IT ADDS / WHY (NOT) IN SCOPE
  -------------------------  ------  ------  ------  ----------------------------------------
  GROUP 2 — GEMM (tl.dot; M3 MMA-equivalence target)
  GEMM_plain_mm              guard   out     out(M3) tl.dot only guarded (unanalyzed-mma) on both; no FP reduce tree.
  GEMM_addmm_bias            guard   out     out(M3) + a bias-add epilogue fused after the dot (still MMA-dominated).
  GEMM_batched_bmm           guard   out     out(M3) 3D batched dot; batch over grid.y/z. Same MMA scope story.
  GROUP 3 — warp-specialized / GPU-arch diversity
  WS_blackwell_ws_tma_mm     guard   out     out(M3) device-TMA + warp_specialize=True + tcgen05 path (sm_100 only;
                                                     TEMPLATE-DERIVED, NOT runnable here). WS invisible to TTGIR;
                                                     PTX can't follow named-barrier partitions -> over-splits.
  GROUP 4 — attention (online softmax + 2 dots)
  ATTN_flex_attention_fwd    partial partial partial the tl.max/tl.sum softmax reduces ARE keyed by TTGIR (in); the two
                                                     tl.dot are guard-only; the running rescale is a loop recurrence
                                                     TTGIR is blind to (safe only by side effect -> tag it).
  GROUP 5 — scan / cross-lane
  SCAN_split_lookback_cumsum out     out     NEITHER *** SOUNDNESS GAP *** decoupled-lookback split scan: TTGIR keys
                                                     only the block-sum reduce, blind to the scan + cross-block carry.
  GROUP 6 — cooperative / cross-CTA reduction
  COOP_xgrid_sum             in*     partial partial a real tt.reduce (in) but the cross-CTA workspace carry +
                                                     x_grid_barrier are opaque to PTX / safe-by-side-effect on TTGIR.
  GROUP 7 — pointwise / foreach (order-insensitive baseline)
  PW_reflection_pad_add      neither neither neither no reduction -> TTGIR () trivially-equal; PTX pure per-element DAG.
  PW_cat_masked              neither neither neither tl.where cat masks; still no cross-lane FP order to constrain.
  FOREACH_combo_add          neither neither neither 4 independent pointwise blocks in one combo/foreach kernel.
  GROUP 8 — non-FP reduction
  RED_any_isinf              in      partial partial boolean OR-reduce: TTGIR keys the combine; PTX won't collapse a
                                                     non-add reduce (_REDUCE_FP={add}). Sound; int, no FP order.

Big-picture takeaway
--------------------
  * GROUP 1: only ``F_cumsum_scan`` is a true SOUNDNESS gap; ``B_layernorm_welford_gather`` is
    the one PTX soundness RISK (gather -> opaque leaf); the other six are already SOUND and only
    OVER-SPLIT (the work there is PRECISION / tuning freedom, not correctness).
  * GROUPS 2+: the second SOUNDNESS gap is ``SCAN_split_lookback_cumsum`` (same tt.scan blind
    spot as F, now with a cross-block carry). GEMM/attention/WS are the M3 (MMA-equivalence)
    frontier — sound today (over-split / guarded), not yet modeled. Pointwise/foreach are the
    trivially-sound floor (no cross-lane FP order to constrain).
  * Net roadmap this corpus points at: (1) model ``tt.scan`` (F + split-scan); (2) model
    gather-fed reductions; (3) recover the num_warps-invariant collapse for multi-output /
    tail-masked / accumulate-then-reduce trees; (4) real FMA/welford numerics on TTGIR;
    (5) MMA / tensor-core equivalence for GEMM + attention + warp specialization (M3).

GROUPS 2+ are not meant to be launched here; their bodies are kept faithful (only the Inductor
``@triton_heuristics(...)`` decorator was replaced with a plain ``@triton.jit`` and the trailing
async-compile wrapper stripped) so they stay inspectable and can be wired into ``evaluate.py``
later if/when the checker grows to cover them. GROUP 1 is faithful in the same way but ALSO
runnable: each ordered add-reduction takes an ``ORD`` param and its hard-coded ``xnumel`` /
``r0_numel`` were made harness arguments, so the M2 harness at the bottom can compile + time it.

# What it computes: the RMS-norm backward pass. TWO add-reductions in one kernel where the
# SECOND reduction's input depends on the FIRST reduction's result (a reduce-of-reduce), wrapped

# Verified scope:  TTGIR = in,  PTX = partial,  overall = partial.  NO soundness gap.
# Novelty vs suite: first kernel with a genuine reduce-of-reduce data dependency (welford has 2
# outputs from ONE reduce; cond_reduce's 3 sums are independent). Both checkers stay sound; PTX
# just over-splits (3 roots + non-layout-invariant leaves: sigmoid in reduce 1, the shfl/smem
# partial from reduce 1 inside reduce 2). TTGIR emits 2 independent positional signatures.

# Novelty vs suite: the first NON-add reduction - TTGIR keys the OR combine; PTX will not collapse it
# (_REDUCE_FP={add}); and since it is integer/boolean there is no FP association order to enforce.

# #########################################################################################
# ## RUNNABLE M2 HARNESS for GROUP 1 (the six ordered add-reductions A, C, D, E, G, H).   ##
# #########################################################################################
# The GROUP 1 kernels above are made runnable via their ``ORD`` param (B_layernorm_welford_gather
# and F_cumsum_scan are OUT of M2 scope — welford's combine and tt.scan are not ordered add-
# reductions — so they stay reference-only). This harness compiles each inner_tree, checks that
# inner_tree == inner_tree+M2 is bit-identical, and reports the 3-way perf (base / +M2 / unordered
# ceiling). It is SELF-CONTAINED: it defines its own input/timing helpers and imports nothing from
# eval_kernels, so Suite 2 stays independent of Suite 1. (This is where complex_fusion_eval.py was
# merged in — the runnable inner_tree transcriptions were a duplicate of these six GROUP 1 bodies.)
#
# Run:  PYTHONPATH=. python -m bitequiv.evaluation.realistic_inductor_kernels [kernels] [num_warps]
# Findings (H100): all six compile inner_tree + are bit-identical under M2; perf ~1.00x with base
# ~= ceiling — these are CONTIGUOUS-axis reductions the compiler already parallelizes, so there is
# no ordered-vs-unordered gap for M2 to close (it correctly inserts nothing). M2's wins need a
# non-contiguous / outer-axis reduce (see eval_kernels GROUP 2). The only fixes this needed were
# harness-level (the ORD param + passing xnumel / r0_numel at launch), not pass changes.
