"""Forward interpreter — the value-DAG reconstruction driver (Phases 0-3).

Walk ``linearize(func)`` in program order over a symbolic thread, maintaining ``regs: name -> Node``
(the value-DAG node each register currently holds) plus transient markers (``_Shuffle`` butterfly
partners, ``_Packed`` f32x2 lane pairs). Each instruction is a transfer function that looks its
operands up in ``regs`` (forward) instead of resolving them backward. The produced value-DAG reuses
:mod:`bitequiv.core.treeir`, so the same ``collapse_balanced`` + ``tree_hash`` yield a descriptor
directly comparable to the backward ``entry_signatures`` (the cross-check oracle).

Modeled so far: ``ld.global`` (scalar + vector slots) -> leaves; the fp combines
(``add/sub/mul/div/min/max``, ``fma``) and the within-warp butterfly ``op(p, shfl.bfly(p, off))`` ->
``ShflCombine`` for any reduce op; ``mov`` pass-through; the cross-warp shared exchange
(``st.shared`` [scalar or VECTOR, per element] -> ``bar.sync`` phase -> ``ld.shared`` / ``ldmatrix``
resolved against the last closed phase under a same-structure guard -> ``SmemExchange``); and packed ``.f32x2``
reductions (``mov.b64`` pack/unpack + ``.f32x2`` combine/fma decomposed per lane). ``st.global``
values are the roots (a packed store expands to one root per f32 lane). A loop-carried
``acc = acc + chunk`` (a chunked / persistent reduction) is summarized as a ``LoopReduce`` fold over
one iteration's chunk (via :mod:`bitequiv.ptx.forward.loops`), recovering num_warps for looped
reductions. MMA-accumulation loops (GEMM K-fold) and data-dependent branches are later phases;
anything unmodeled becomes an ``Opaque`` and, if it would strip a transient marker (losing a
reduction ordering / packed structure), trips ``faithful=False`` — the sound floor that falls back to
the conservative fingerprint. Integer/address ops do not touch the value state (their values live in
the affine domain, resolved on demand for leaf coordinates).
