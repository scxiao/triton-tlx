"""Shared MMA (tensor-core) fence for the bitwise-equivalence checker.

An MMA op (``wgmma`` / ``mma.sync`` / ``wmma`` / ``tcgen05.mma``) is a COLLECTIVE matmul whose
internal accumulation order we do not reconstruct. Instead we summarize an entry's MMA ops with a
tiling-invariant FENCE: a conjunction of facts that can only SPLIT equivalence classes, never merge
them. This lets the autotuner keep MMA configs that differ ONLY in a bit-irrelevant tiling choice
(BLOCK_M / BLOCK_N re-tiling, num_warps) in one class, while separating anything that changes the
bits (K split, operand/accumulator dtype, scale/accumulate flags).

Soundness (over-split, never over-merge):
- Each KEPT token piece is bit-relevant: K (the products summed per hardware pass — regrouping K
  changes the sum) and the operand + accumulator dtypes (rounding). tcgen05 keeps ``.kind::`` (dtype
  family) and ``.cta_group::`` (2-CTA changes the accumulation).
- Each DROPPED piece is tiling-free: the m/n tile dims (retiling the SAME dot products across a
  different BLOCK_M / BLOCK_N is bit-identical) and the issue/transpose mods
  (``.mma_async`` / ``.sync`` / ``.aligned`` / ``.row`` / ``.col``).
- The f32 epilogue fp ops ride as PRESENCE ``(has_fma, has_addmul)`` — NOT a count: the op count
  scales with the M/N tile (elements per thread) while tcgen05's mma count does not, so a count
  (even GCD-reduced) cannot cancel the tile scaling and over-splits equivalent re-tilings (measured:
  num_splits 1..8 x tilings -> 20 classes for a 4-class split-K kernel). Presence keeps
  enable_fp_fusion (fma single-rounded vs add+mul double-rounded) distinct; the bit-relevant K
  regrouping rides the token / caller's ``loops=`` (BLOCK_K) / ``splits=`` (num_splits) instead.
- fp8 (e4m3/e5m2/...): the ``max_num_imprecise_acc`` periodic-flush cadence is invisible even to
  presence, so we FALL BACK to the raw per-token count map + raw fp count (strictly more splitting).
- tcgen05 M/N/K live in a runtime descriptor, not the modifiers, so tcgen05 K rides ``loops=``
  (BLOCK_K) + ``splits=`` (num_splits) rather than the token — conservative.

This module is the single source of truth for both the forward interpreter and the backward
``_entry_signature`` (which currently uses the coarser ``_mma_guard``).

    can move freely between them. Keeps only the bit-relevant facts — the accumulation dtype FAMILY and
    the CTA group (2-CTA changes the accumulation) — and drops the FORM (mma vs tcgen05), the native
    m/n/k tile, and the issue/transpose mods (all bit-free re-tilings of the same dot products).

    Why v2 == v5 is sound for f16/bf16/tf32 (INFERRED, not an NVIDIA guarantee): for these types each
    product ``A*B`` is exact in f32 (f16/tf32 give <=22 product significand bits, bf16 <=16, f32 holds
    24 -> no rounding on the multiply), and both forms on the same Blackwell chip add the exact products
    in the same wide fixed-point accumulator (F=25 fractional bits) with a single normalize -> same
    bits. NVIDIA documents none of this; it is corroborated by two reverse-engineered bit-accurate
    tensor-core models (arXiv 2511.10909 map both HMMA and UTCHMMA to FDA(F=25); arXiv 2512.07004 find
    B200 == H100/H200 behavior, tensor cores NOT IEEE-754) and by our GB300 corpus (v2 and v5 land in
    one bit class for f16/bf16/tf32). fp8 is the EXCEPTION and is kept conservative below: fp8
    accumulation runs in limited precision with a periodic promote-to-f32 (Triton `max_num_imprecise_acc`
    + a fp8-specific block ordering) that need not match across the two lowerings, so fp8 v2 != v5.

    Note (dtype-relative): a native tcgen05 GEMM does not encode the specific operand dtype (``.kind::f16``
    covers f16 AND bf16; the inputs are untyped ``.b16``), so the family cannot tell f16 from bf16 for
    v5. The token is therefore dtype-RELATIVE: f16 and bf16 share the "f16" family. This is sound for
