"""Reduction-tree IR + canonical serialization.

A reconstructed reduction is a tree whose **leaves** are loaded tensor elements
(labeled by the recovered layout coordinate) and whose **internal nodes** are the
floating-point combine ops, the within-/cross-warp butterfly shuffles, and the
shared-memory exchanges. Two PTX modules reduce in the same bitwise order iff their
canonical tree strings are equal.

Canonicalization rules (the bit-safety frontier — a canonicalization is allowed only when
it provably cannot change the bits; an unsafe one would let the checker wrongly merge):

* MAY reorder children only where IEEE makes it bit-identical: the two children of a
  *separately-rounded* commutative ``add``/``mul`` are sorted; ``fma``'s multiply pair
  (children[:2]) is sorted but the addend (children[2]) stays positional.
* MUST stay positional: ``sub``/``div``; ``min``/``max`` (NaN-payload caution); the
  butterfly **offset sequence**; the overall tree *shape* (left-fold vs balanced tree is
  never re-associated). All op modifiers (``.rn``/``.rz``/``.ftz``/width) ride into the
  node string verbatim — this is where FMA-contraction / rounding sensitivity lives.

Each node exposes ``children`` (sub-nodes) and ``sig_local(child_sigs)`` (this node's
canonical string given its children's strings). ``sig()`` composes them recursively for
convenience; deep trees are serialized iteratively in :func:`bitequiv.core.canonicalize.tree_sig`
to avoid Python's recursion limit on long within-thread folds.
