"""Baselines and the verdict.

The enforcing metric is **speedup against a reference measured in the same
process and the same run** -- for mm, ``torch.matmul``. A ratio taken that way
is immune to clock state, thermal history, driver version and machine identity,
all of which move absolute milliseconds by more than the regression we are
trying to detect. Phase 1 measured that directly: the same kernel spanned 13.9%
across-run spread unlocked and 1.7% denoised, while its ratio to torch barely
moved.

Absolute milliseconds are still recorded, and still compared, but only as an
informational signal. They drift; the ratio does not.

Compile time is the exception and is judged against an absolute cap rather than
a baseline at all -- see ``compile.py``.
