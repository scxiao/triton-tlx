"""Steady-state latency measurement.

Sampling is **blocked**, deliberately: a provider's whole warmup+measure window
runs to completion before the next provider starts. That is what tritonbench
does -- ``utils/triton_op.py`` reduces over providers per input, each fully
measured -- and matching it is what keeps our absolute milliseconds comparable
to a tritonbench run of the same shape.

The measurement loop itself is ``triton.testing.do_bench``, which already
flushes L2 before every rep and records per-rep events. What this module adds
around it is tritonbench's default policy, ported rather than imported:

* size warmup/rep from a cheap runtime estimate
  (``components/do_bench/utils.py``, ``utils/constants.py``)
* reject outliers by IQR and summarize on the median
  (``Latency`` in ``components/do_bench/run.py``)

Ported and not imported because this suite must not depend on the tritonbench
wheel. The behaviour is intended to match; the debt is that it can drift, so
each port names its source.

#: Warmup per replicate, in ms. NOT the estimate-based table above, which is
#: opt-in via ``auto_window=True``.
#:
#: The table gives a ~1 ms kernel a 25 ms warmup -- about 24 iterations -- which
#: is nowhere near thermal steady state. Measured on a clock-locked B200,
#: mm 8192x8192x8192 fp16 moved from 13.9% to 1.7% between-run spread when the
#: window went from the table's to 3s. This is the expensive part of a replicate
#: and the part that is load-bearing, so it is not sized down.
DEFAULT_WARMUP_MS = 3000

#: Total timed iterations across all replicates, floor.
#:
#: The measurement window is derived from this rather than fixed, because what
#: matters is how many samples stand behind the number, not how many
#: milliseconds were spent collecting them -- a fixed window silently gives a
#: fast kernel 50x the samples of a slow one.
MIN_TOTAL_SAMPLES = 1000

#: Floor on the measurement window itself, in ms.
#:
#: Without it a fast kernel meets the sample quota in ~10 ms, which is a short
#: enough slice of time to catch a single scheduling artefact and call it the
#: answer. Costs nothing: warmup dominates a replicate regardless.
MIN_REP_MS = 200

#: Number of independent measurement replicates per case.
#:
#: Replicates exist only to catch drift *between* runs -- within a run the mean
#: is already precise once the sample quota is met -- so this is the smallest
#: number giving a usable spread rather than the largest affordable. Three is
#: the bare minimum from which any spread can be read; five leaves margin
#: without multiplying the warmup, which is what dominates a replicate.
DEFAULT_REPLICATES = 5

#: A case whose reported p50 does not reproduce this closely across replicates
#: gets no perf verdict.
#:
#: Compared against ``Stat.rel_max_deviation`` -- BETWEEN-run reproducibility of
#: the reported mean, NOT the within-run ``cv``. Measured on a denoised B200,
#: compute-bound shapes reproduce to 0.4-1.7%, so 2% is the achievable floor
#: plus a little margin. An earlier version compared this number against a
#: within-run figure (5-7% for the same shapes, because the power-governed
#: clock wanders) and rejected healthy cases.
MAX_REPLICATE_DEVIATION = 0.02

#: A case is host-bound when its latency is below this multiple of the host
#: cost of issuing one call.
#:
#: The host issues iteration N+1 while the GPU runs iteration N, so host
#: overhead does not add to latency -- it only starves the GPU once it exceeds
#: kernel time. The threshold is therefore just above 1, not far above it. An
#: earlier value of 5.0 flagged mm 8192x8192x1024 (138us measured against 42us
#: host, and torch needs 128us for the same work, so the kernel plainly
#: dominates) as unmeasurable.
#:
#: Measured on B200: ``tlx.ops.mm`` costs 43-63us of host time per call -- 4
#: TensorDescriptor constructions, the autotuner key lookup, and, when
#: SPLIT_K > 1, a fresh ``torch.empty((SPLIT_K*M, N))`` in the config pre_hook
#: -- against ~9us for ``torch.matmul``. At mm 2048x2048x2048 the whole measured
#: latency was 54us while host cost alone was 63us: the GPU idles waiting for
#: the launch and the number describes Python.
