"""Environment verification and capture.

``third_party/tlx/denoise.sh`` remains the thing that *applies* the lock. This
module deliberately does not re-implement it in Python: duplicating privileged
shell logic would give two sources of truth for what "denoised" means, and the
copy would drift.

What it does is verify the environment, watch the GPU's operating point while a
case is measured, and record all of it into the artifact -- a latency reported
without its environment is not comparable to anything, and phase 1 measured how
large that difference is (13.9% vs 1.7% across-run spread on one kernel).

**Do not check for a locked SM clock.** Measured on B200: under a sustained
8192x8192x8192 fp16 GEMM the card runs at ~830 MHz and reports ``sw_power_cap``
whether or not ``nvidia-smi -lgc 1965`` has been applied -- the operating point
is set by the power budget long before the clock cap binds, so ``-lgc`` is
close to a no-op for compute-bound work. A "clocks are not locked" check would
have fired on every correct run. What ``denoise.sh`` actually contributes for
this workload is a *fixed* power cap, persistence mode, and NUMA binding; the
rest of the stability comes from warming to steady state (see
``measure.DEFAULT_WARMUP_MS``).

So verification here is behavioural: watch the operating point rather than the
configuration that was meant to produce it.
