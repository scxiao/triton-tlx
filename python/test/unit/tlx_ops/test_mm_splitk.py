"""Split-K workspace layout for ``tlx.ops.mm`` (sm100).

White-box: the public API cannot pin ``SPLIT_K``/``NUM_CTAS``, and the invariant
is host arithmetic whose only symptom is silently wrong rows.

The bug: workspace was ``(SPLIT_K * M, N)``, giving split ``s`` the rows
``[s*M, (s+1)*M)``, but the epilogue stores whole ``BLOCK_SIZE_M`` tiles on a
``padded_num_pid_m`` grid. The overhang is interior to the descriptor, so TMA
does not drop it and it overwrites split ``s+1``'s partials.

Two triggers: ``M % BLOCK_SIZE_M != 0``, or ``NUM_CTAS=2`` with an odd tile
count, which pads by a whole tile row even when ``M % BLOCK_SIZE_M == 0``.

The layout tests need no GPU and no compile.
