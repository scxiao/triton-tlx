# Barrier Insertion

This document describes how `producer_acquire`, `consumer_release`, and
related synchronization primitives are inserted during the warp specialization
code partition pass. This is the implementation-level complement to the
high-level overview in [Code Partitioning](CodePartition.md) and the
optimization-focused [Barrier Fusion](BarrierFusion.md).

**File**: `WSCodePartition.cpp` → `insertAsyncComm()`

## Overview

When data flows between two partitions (tasks), the pass creates a
**communication channel** with synchronization primitives. The choice of
primitives depends on whether the producer or consumer is a `TCGen5MMAOp`
(gen5 MMA).

There are two synchronization mechanisms:
1. **Token-based**: Explicit `ProducerAcquireOp` / `ProducerCommitOp` /
   `ConsumerWaitOp` / `ConsumerReleaseOp`.
2. **Gen5 inline barrier**: `WaitBarrierOp` + the MMA's built-in completion
   barrier. No explicit acquire/release ops.

## Key Decision: `useGen5Barrier`

`useGen5Barrier` is true when every actual consumer in the current consumer
task implements `MMAv5OpInterface`. The decision is made independently for
each consumer task. Channels that reuse the same physical slot must agree on
the mode, so the check covers every channel in the reuse group: one scalar
consumer makes that task token-based for the entire group. Multi-buffer groups
share tokens; single-copy groups retain separate tokens.

When true → `consumerBarriers` is populated (an inline barrier alloc is
created).
When false → only a **token** (`nvws.create_token`) is created.

Separately, a **`producerBarrier`** is allocated when the producer is a TMA
load (`DescriptorLoadOp`) or gen5 MMA (`ProducerIsGen5`).

## Path 1: Token-Based (Consumer Task is NOT gen5-only)

Applies to each token whose consumer task has no entry in
`commChannel.consumerBarriers`. A channel may use an inline barrier for one
consumer task and token synchronization for another.

### `ProducerAcquireOp`

```cpp
if (!commChannel.consumerBarriers.count(token.first)) {
    auto producerAcquirePoint =
        getSameLevelOp(headConsumer, tmaHeadProducer);
    if (producerAcquireForChannelLoop) {
        builder.setInsertionPoint(producerAcquireForChannelLoop);
    } else {
        builder.setInsertionPoint(producerAcquirePoint);
    }
    builder.createWithAsyncTaskIds<ttnvws::ProducerAcquireOp>(
        headProducer->getLoc(), token, bufferIdx, phase);
}
```

- Inserted **before** the head producer.
- For loop-carried channels, moved to before the backward channel's `dstOp`.
- Uses the **producer's** async task IDs.

### `ConsumerReleaseOp`

```cpp
if (!commChannel.consumerBarriers.count(token.first)) {
    auto consumerReleasePoint =
        consumerReleaseHeuristic(tailProducer, tailConsumer, consumerTaskId);
    builder.setInsertionPointAfter(consumerReleasePoint);
    builder.createWithAsyncTaskIds<ttnvws::ConsumerReleaseOp>(
        consumerReleasePoint->getLoc(), token, bufferIdx);
}
```

- Inserted **after** `consumerReleasePoint`.
- `consumerReleaseHeuristic` finds the latest point where the consumer data is
  still needed by tracing `getActualConsumers()` and computing the common
  post-dominator.

### `ProducerCommitOp`

Only when there is **no `producerBarrier`** (producer is neither TMA nor gen5):

- Inserted **after** `tailProducer`.
- Special case for TMEM channels where producer is `TMEMStoreOp` feeding gen5
  operand A: commit is delayed to after both tmem_stores (data + acc D).

### `ConsumerWaitOp`

Only when there is **no `producerBarrier`**:

- Inserted **before** `headConsumer`.

## Path 2: Gen5 Inline Barrier (Consumer Task is gen5-only)

Applies to each consumer task with an entry in
`commChannel.consumerBarriers`.

### Producer Acquire → `WaitBarrierOp` with Inverted Phase

`desyncTCGen5MMAOp()` is called with `asProducerAcquire=true`. It inserts
a `WaitBarrierOp` **before the producer** using **inverted phase**
(`xor true`). This waits for the buffer-empty barrier — semantically
equivalent to a producer_acquire.

```cpp
if (asProducerAcquire) {
    Value _1_1b = builder.createWithAsyncTaskIds<arith::ConstantIntOp>(
        loc, 1, 1);
    phase = builder.createWithAsyncTaskIds<mlir::arith::XOrIOp>(
        loc, inPhase, _1_1b);
}
phase = builder.createWithAsyncTaskIds<arith::ExtUIOp>(loc, i32Type, phase);
auto waitOp = builder.createWithAsyncTaskIds<ttng::WaitBarrierOp>(
    loc, producerBarrier, phase);
```

### Consumer Release → Implicit via gen5 Inline Barrier

The gen5 MMA's inline barrier is attached as a **completion barrier
operand**:

```cpp
mmaOp.addCompletionBarrier(consumerBarrier, pred);
mmaOp.setIsAsync(true);
```

When the MMA completes, it signals this barrier. No explicit
`ConsumerReleaseOp` is emitted — the MMA lowering handles it.

## Path for gen5 as Producer (`producerBarrier` set)

When the **producer** is gen5, `desyncTCGen5MMAOp()` is called with
`asProducerAcquire=false`:

- The MMA's inline barrier is attached as a **completion barrier**
  (producer_commit).
- A `WaitBarrierOp` is inserted **before the consumer** as a consumer_wait.

## Summary Table

| Consumer task | `consumerBarriers` entry | Producer Acquire | Producer Commit | Consumer Wait | Consumer Release |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gen5-only | Present | `WaitBarrierOp` (inverted phase) before producer | Implicit via gen5 inline barrier | Implicit via gen5 inline barrier | Implicit via gen5 inline barrier |
| Not gen5-only; producer is not gen5/TMA | Absent | `ProducerAcquireOp` before head producer | `ProducerCommitOp` after tail producer | `ConsumerWaitOp` before head consumer | `ConsumerReleaseOp` after last actual consumer |
| Not gen5-only; producer is gen5 | Absent | `ProducerAcquireOp` before head producer | Implicit via gen5 inline barrier + `WaitBarrierOp` before consumer | `WaitBarrierOp` before head consumer | `ConsumerReleaseOp` after last actual consumer |
| Not gen5-only; producer is TMA | Absent | `ProducerAcquireOp` before head producer | TMA barrier expect (via `optimizeTMALoads`) | `WaitBarrierOp` on TMA barrier before consumer | `ConsumerReleaseOp` after last actual consumer |

## Examples: FA BWD Channels

### Channel `dq` (TMEM, gen5 → tmem_load)

- **Producer**: `tc_gen5_mma` (task 1, gemm) computes `dq = dsT^T @ k`.
- **Consumer**: `tmem_load` (task 0, computation) reads the result.
- **`producerBarrier`** is set (producer is gen5).
- **`useGen5Barrier = false`** (consumer `tmem_load` is not gen5) →
  `consumerBarriers` empty.
- Result:
  - `ProducerAcquireOp` before the MMA (token-based).
  - Gen5 inline barrier signals MMA completion (producer_commit).
  - `WaitBarrierOp` before `tmem_load` (consumer_wait on the producer
    barrier).
  - `ConsumerReleaseOp` after `tmem_load` (token-based).

### Channel `dsT` (SMEM, local_store → gen5)

- **Producer**: `local_store` (task 3, computation) writes `dsT` to SMEM.
- **Consumer**: `tc_gen5_mma` for dk and dq (task 1, gemm) reads `dsT` as
  an operand.
- **`producerBarrier`** is not set (producer is `local_store`, not TMA/gen5).
- **`useGen5Barrier = true`** (all consumers in task 1 are gen5) →
  `consumerBarriers` populated.
- Result:
  - `WaitBarrierOp` with inverted phase before `local_store` (acts as
    producer_acquire via gen5 inline barrier).
  - `ProducerCommitOp` after `local_store`.
  - `ConsumerWaitOp` before gen5 MMA.
  - Gen5 inline barrier signals buffer-empty on MMA completion (acts as
    consumer_release).
  - **No** explicit `ProducerAcquireOp` or `ConsumerReleaseOp`.

## FA BWD HD64 Barrier Map

This section provides a complete barrier map for the Flash Attention BWD
persistent kernel with `HEAD_DIM=64`, serving as a concrete reference for
how all the pieces fit together.

### Partitions

| Partition | Type | async_task_id | Warps | Role |
|-----------|------|---------------|-------|------|
| default / partition0 | reduction | 0 | 1 | dQ epilogue: tmem_load dQ → scale → TMA atomic_add to global |
| partition1 | gemm | 1 | 1 | All MMA operations: qkT, dpT, dV, dK, dQ |
| partition2 | load | 2 | 8 | TMA loads: k, v, q, do |
| partition3 | computation | 3 | 8 | Softmax, ppT, dsT computation; tmem_load qkT/dpT; tmem_store ppT |

### TMEM Allocations

| Name | Shape | shareGroup | buffer.id | Encoding |
|------|-------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| dpT  | 1×128×128×f32 | 2 | 8 | blockM=128, blockN=128 |
| qkT  | 1×128×128×f32 | 0 | 7 | blockM=128, blockN=128 |
| dv   | 1×128×64×f32  | 1 | 6 | blockM=128, blockN=64  |
| dk   | 1×128×64×f32  | 3 | 5 | blockM=128, blockN=64  |

### SMEM Allocations

| Name | Shape | buffer.id | Notes |
|------|-------|-----------|-------|
| dsT  | 2×128×128×f16 | 0 | double-buffered |
| do   | 2×128×64×f16  | 1 | double-buffered |
| q    | 2×128×64×f16  | 2 | double-buffered |
| v    | 1×128×64×f16  | 3 | single-buffered |
| k    | 1×128×64×f16  | 4 | single-buffered |

### MMA Operations (all in Task 1 / partition1)

| MMA | Operand D (TMEM) | useAcc | Commit barriers |
|-----|-----------------|--------|-----------------|
| qkT MMA | qkT (memdesc_index) | `false` | 1×1 HW commit |
| dpT MMA | dpT (memdesc_index) | `false` | 2×1 (do consumed) + 1×1 (HW commit) |
| dV MMA  | dv (memdesc_index)  | loop-carried | 1×1 HW commit |
| dK MMA  | dk (memdesc_index)  | loop-carried | 2×1 (q consumed) |
| dQ MMA  | dq (tmem_subslice of dpT, cols 0-63) | `false` | 2×1 (dsT consumed) + 1×1 (dQ commit for Task 0) |

### dQ Operand D Chain

The dQ MMA's operand D is NOT a separate TMEM allocation. It is derived from
the dpT allocation via:

```
%dpT_86 = tmem_subslice %dpT_9 {offset = 0}        → cols 0-63 of dpT (128×128)
%dpT_87 = memdesc_reinterpret %dpT_86          → 1×128×64
%dq_88  = memdesc_index %dpT_87[0]             → 128×64
dQ MMA writes to %dq_88
```

This is safe because of the **transitive dependency chain** — by the time dQ
MMA executes, dpT has been consumed by Task 3 (see dpT flow below).

### Complete Barrier Map

| `%62` | `%arg61` | 1×1 | qkT consumed (Task 3 → Task 1) |

### Producer-Consumer Barrier Flows

#### Flow 1: qkT (shareGroup 0)

```
Task 1: wait %arg61 (qkT consumed) → qkT MMA → commit %arg25 (HW)
Task 3: wait %arg25 (qkT committed) → tmem_load qkT → arrive %arg61 (qkT consumed)
```

#### Flow 2: dpT (shareGroup 2) — most complex

```
Task 1: wait %arg57 (dQ consumed) + wait %arg59 (dpT consumed) → dpT MMA →
        commit %arg32 (do consumed) + %arg33 (HW)
Task 3: wait %arg33 (dpT committed) → tmem_load dpT → arrive %arg59 (dpT consumed)
Task 2: wait %arg32 (do consumed) → TMA load do
```

#### Flow 3: dV (shareGroup 1)

```
Task 0: tmem_store zeros → dV (init)
Task 3: wait %arg29 (dV committed) → tmem_store ppT → arrive %arg60 (ppT ready)
Task 1: wait %arg60 (ppT ready) → dV MMA (useAcc=true) → commit %arg29 (HW)
Task 3 (epilog): wait %arg41 → tmem_load dV → TMA store to global
```

#### Flow 4: dK (shareGroup 3)

```
Task 0: tmem_store zeros → dK (init)
Task 1: wait %arg58 (dsT ready) → dK MMA (useAcc=true) → commit %arg36 (q consumed)
Task 2: wait %arg36 (q consumed) → TMA load q
Task 3 (epilog): wait %arg39 → tmem_load dK → TMA store to global
```

#### Flow 5: dQ (subslice of dpT, shareGroup 2)

```
Task 1: dQ MMA (after dK MMA) → commit %arg37 (dsT consumed) +
        %arg38 (dQ ready for Task 0)
Task 0: wait %arg38 (dQ committed) → tmem_load dQ (4 × 128×16 chunks) →
        cp.reduce → arrive %arg57 (dQ consumed)
Task 1: wait %arg57 (dQ consumed) → dpT MMA (next iteration)
Task 3: wait %arg37 (dsT consumed) → store next dsT to SMEM
```

#### Flow 6: dsT (SMEM, double-buffered)

```
Task 3: wait %arg37 (dsT consumed) → local_store dsT → arrive %arg58 (dsT ready)
Task 1: wait %arg58 (dsT ready) → dK MMA (reads dsT) → dQ MMA (reads dsT)
Task 1: dQ MMA commit → arrive %arg37 (dsT consumed)
```

### Key Insight: dpT/dQ TMEM Sharing Is Safe

The dQ MMA writes to columns 0-63 of the dpT TMEM buffer. This does NOT race
with Task 3's `tmem_load dpT` because of the **transitive dependency chain**:

```
dpT MMA (Task 1)
  → commit %arg33 (dpT HW commit)
    → Task 3 waits %arg33
      → tmem_load dpT (Task 3 CONSUMES dpT)
        → compute dsT = pT * (dpT - Di)
          → local_store dsT to SMEM
            → arrive %arg58 (dsT READY)
              → Task 1 waits %arg58
                → dK MMA (reads dsT from SMEM)
                  → dQ MMA (writes to dpT subslice) ← dpT already consumed!
```

### Barrier Initialization

All barriers are initialized with `init_barrier ..., 1` (arrival count = 1).
Barriers are separated by `gpu.barrier` calls to ensure visibility across
warp groups before the `warp_specialize` region begins.

Single-buffered barriers (`1×1`): phase alternates `curr_m & 1`.
Double-buffered barriers (`2×1`): indexed by `tile_idx % 2`.

## Known Issues: BWD Persistent Kernel Bugs

This section documents known bugs found during BWD persistent kernel
bring-up. Some are fixed; others remain open.

### Bug 1 — 2-Buffer Reuse Group Fires Incorrectly (NaN results)

**Status:** Fixed (commit `92a456c0`)

The 2-buffer reuse group logic moved `producer_acquire` for a late channel
before an early channel's producer **even when the late channel's consumer was
in a different control block**. In the BWD kernel this corrupted the MMA
pipeline ordering, leading to reads of uninitialized TMEM.

**Fix:** Added a guard condition requiring the late consumer to be in the
**same block** as the early producer. See [Reuse Groups](ReuseGroups.md) for
the full 2-buffer reuse group design.

### Bug 2 — TMA Store Column Offset

**Status:** Fixed (commit `b56dee56`)

With `EPILOGUE_SUBTILE = 4`, all four TMA store chunks used hardcoded column
offset `0`, causing every chunk to overwrite the first 32 columns. This was
a kernel authoring bug, not a compiler bug.

### Bug 3 — dK Race Condition (Reduction Zeros TMEM Before Computation Reads)

**Status:** Fixed

The gemm partition's `tc_gen5_commit` signaled both bar_A (for the reduction's
tmem_store) and bar_B (for the computation's tmem_load) simultaneously. The
tmem_store zeroed dk TMEM while tmem_load was still reading it.

See [Operand D Handling](OperandDHandling.md#the-operand-d-race--and-the-fix)
for the full race analysis, the token-based fix, and the same-task guard for
FA FWD.

### Bug 4 — dV Accuracy at BM64 (Open)

**Status:** Open — root cause confirmed via runtime diagnostics

**Error:** `max|err| = 0.98` (non-deterministic). Affected gradient: dV only.
First tile per CTA always passes; subsequent tiles fail ~18% of the time.

**Root cause:** Same race pattern as Bug 3 — the reduction partition zeroes dV
TMEM for the next outer iteration while the computation partition is still
reading dV. The TTGIR-level guard channel barrier wiring is correct for both
dk and dv. The error is **downstream of TTGIR** — in token/barrier lowering
or TMEM physical allocation.

**Analysis:** The autoWS compiler generates redundant cross-partition TMEM
zeroing (`tmem_store dense<0.0>`) that creates an unresolvable race condition.
TLX relies entirely on the MMA's `useC=false` flag on the first inner loop
iteration to zero the accumulator, avoiding the race entirely.

Confirmed via `TRITON_KERNEL_OVERRIDE`: removing the two `tmem_store` zeroing
instructions from the reduction partition while keeping all barrier
waits/arrives intact produces **ALL PASS** with 0.0 error.

**Remaining hypotheses:**
1. **Token/barrier lowering bug** (`WSLowerToken.cpp`): The guard token's
   lowering may produce incorrect barrier semantics for dv.
2. **TMEM allocation collision**: Physical TMEM column assignments may overlap
   under high SM occupancy (>1 tile per CTA).
3. **Async MMA pipeline ordering**: The dV MMA's completion may be reordered
   relative to the guard channel arrive.
