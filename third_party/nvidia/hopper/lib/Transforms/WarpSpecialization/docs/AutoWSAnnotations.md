# AutoWS Loop Annotations

**Frontend**: `python/triton/language/core.py` (`AutoWSLoopOptions`, `range`,
`condition`), `python/triton/compiler/code_generator.py` (`_apply_loop_options`)

**Consumers**: the pipeliner (`AssignLatencies`, `ScheduleLoops`,
`SoftwarePipeliner`) and AutoWS (`PartitionSchedulingMeta`, `WSDataPartition`,
`LoopUnroll`, `FuseNestedLoops`).

This doc describes the loop annotations that drive automatic warp specialization
and pipelining: where they come from, what IR attribute each becomes, which pass
consumes it, and — importantly — which of them currently work on an `scf.while`
loop vs. only on `scf.for`.

## Where the annotations come from

The annotations are keyword arguments on the two loop front-ends:

```python
for i in tl.range(0, N, warp_specialize=True, num_stages=3, data_partition_factor=2):
    ...
while tl.condition(sched.is_valid(), warp_specialize=True, data_partition_factor=2):
    ...
```

Both `tl.range` (for loops) and `tl.condition` (while loops) inherit a single
dataclass, **`AutoWSLoopOptions`** (`core.py`), which owns the frontend option
set, defaults, and IR-attribute mapping. `visit_For` and `visit_While` both emit
them via the shared `_apply_loop_options` helper, so a `for` and a `while`
receive byte-identical attributes.

The C++ inventory and scheduler-loop propagation policy are centralized in
`include/triton/Dialect/Triton/IR/DiscardableAttributes.h` and
`lib/Dialect/Triton/IR/DiscardableAttributes.cpp`. The registry contains every
attribute emitted by `AutoWSLoopOptions`, including attributes consumed before
the single-trip rewrite and those that must be forwarded to the inner compute
loop. A new frontend option must add one registry entry and choose its
propagation policy; transforms such as `SimplifySingleTripWhile` filter this
registry instead of maintaining private allowlists. Internal scheduling
metadata such as `tt.scheduled_max_stage` remains separate from the frontend
AutoWS inventory.

## Annotation → IR attribute → consumer

| kwarg | IR attribute | Consumed by | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `num_stages` | `tt.num_stages` | `AssignLatencies`, `SoftwarePipeliner` | software-pipeline depth |
| `warp_specialize` | `tt.warp_specialize` | `ScheduleLoops` → `PartitionSchedulingMeta` | marks the loop for WS |
| `data_partition_factor` | `tt.data_partition_factor` | `PartitionSchedulingMeta`, `WSDataPartition` | # consumer slices along M/N |
| `loop_unroll_factor` | `tt.loop_unroll_factor` | `LoopUnroll` (TTIR) | IR-level unroll |
| `flatten` | `tt.flatten` | `FuseNestedLoops` | flatten a loop nest |
| `disallow_acc_multi_buffer` | `tt.disallow_acc_multi_buffer` | pipeliner | keep acc single-buffered |
| `multi_cta` | `tt.multi_cta` | multi-CTA reduction | cluster-level reduction |
| `merge_epilogue` / `merge_epilogue_to_computation` / `merge_correction` | `tt.merge_*` | `PartitionSchedulingMeta` (`SchedulingOptions`) | epilogue/correction routing |
| `separate_epilogue_store` | `tt.separate_epilogue_store` | `PartitionSchedulingMeta` | epilogue store gets own partition |
| `tmem_alloc_algo` / `smem_alloc_algo` / `smem_budget` / `smem_circular_reuse` | `tt.{tmem,smem}_alloc_algo`, `tt.smem_budget`, `tt.smem_circular_reuse` | `WSMemoryPlanner` | allocation heuristics |
| `list_schedule_pick` / `mem_plan_pick` | `tt.list_schedule_pick` / `tt.mem_plan_pick` | list scheduler / `WSMemoryPlanner` | ranked schedule and memory-plan selection |
| `disable_licm` | `llvm.loop_annotation` | LICM | suppress hoisting |

See `PartitionSchedulingMeta.md` for how the `merge_*` / `separate_epilogue_store`
knobs shape the partition layout.

## Operation scheduling annotations

AutoWS kernels may also attach `tt.autows` to individual dot operations and
latency-bearing loads. A dot annotation has `stage` and `order` fields and
defines the computation order within an annotated loop. `ScheduleLoops` keeps
that dot order unchanged while placing loads from each dot's backward slice in
dedicated prefetch clusters. The default load rank is:

```text
(dot stage + dot order, dot stage, dot order)
```

This rank expresses the prefetch wavefront independently of the computation
wavefront. For example, a stage-zero input for the next contraction can be
issued before a stage-one input for the current contraction.

`tensor_descriptor.load(..., attrs={"stage": "0", "order": "2"})` supplies an
explicit load rank when dependency inference is insufficient, such as scalar
metadata shared by multiple contractions. Explicit load annotations override
the inferred consumer rank. Loads outside every annotated dot's backward slice
retain dependency-based scheduling.

Both fields are JSON **strings** holding a decimal integer, matching the dot
annotation encoding; the frontend rejects non-string `attrs` values so an
integer cannot be silently dropped by the compiler-side parse. An annotation
that is not a JSON object, is missing a field, or holds a non-integer string
is ignored with a `-debug-only=triton-loop-pipeline` message and the op falls
back to the inferred rank.

## Status on `scf.while` (current gaps)

The unified tile scheduler (`triton.language.schedule`) drives a persistent
kernel with an `scf.while` outer loop. The annotations are *attached* to the
`while` identically to a `for` (via `tl.condition`) and survive into TTGIR, but
whether they take *effect* depends on the schedule:

| Schedule | outer-loop handling | annotations effective? |
|---|---|---|
| static persistent | uplifted to `scf.for` (`triton-uplift-while-to-for`) | **yes** — treated as a normal `for` |
| dynamic persistent | stays `scf.while` (atomic advance) | **partial** — see below |
| CLC | stays `scf.while` (hardware `_valid`) | **partial** — see below |
| non-persistent | kept through data partitioning, then eliminated before the default loop schedule | **yes** — AutoWS is forwarded to the first-level inner loop |

For non-persistent schedules on Hopper and Blackwell,
`triton-simplify-single-trip-while` deliberately runs in TTGIR after data
partitioning and before default latency assignment and loop scheduling. Before
inlining the single-trip while, it forwards the still-live AutoWS attributes to
`scf.for` loops exactly one loop-nesting level inside the scheduler while. This
is based on the nearest enclosing loop, so intervening non-loop control flow
such as `scf.if` is transparent, while a nested second-level loop is excluded.
This lets downstream scheduling and warp-specialization passes operate on the
inner loop without hiding the outer loop from data partitioning. An annotated
while with no first-level inner target is preserved rather than silently losing
warp specialization. Attributes whose
consumers already ran, such as `tt.list_schedule_pick`, are not forwarded;
later consumers such as the memory planner and multi-CTA reduction still
receive `tt.mem_plan_pick` and `tt.multi_cta`, respectively. Existing
attributes on the selected inner loop take precedence over outer defaults.

### `warp_specialize` on a non-countable `while`

`ttg.warp_specialize` is emitted by the pipeline `ScheduleLoops` →
`PartitionSchedulingMeta` → `hopper_warpspec`. `PartitionSchedulingMeta` accepts
`scf.while` loops whose condition forwards a direct non-empty ordered subset of carried
values, and derives their partitions structurally from the after region.
`ScheduleLoops` remains `scf.for`-only: the non-countable outer
while is not software-pipelined, while its nested K-loop retains the existing
for-loop software pipeline. Downstream dynamic/CLC validation is tracked in
**[WarpSpecializeWhileLoops.md](WarpSpecializeWhileLoops.md)**.

### `num_stages` / pipelining on a `while`: not applicable

Software pipelining is `scf.for`-only, and a non-countable `while` has no trip
count to stage. We also do **not** want to pipeline the persistent outer loop.
`num_stages` on a dynamic/CLC `while` is therefore inert (worth a frontend
warning); it applies once the static `while` is uplifted to a `for`.

### `data_partition_factor` on a `while`: the *pass* works; the *pipeline* is gated

The data-partition pass (`WSDataPartition`) **does** handle `scf.while` — it
splits a while-carried accumulator + dot along M/N and follows the before/after
regions correctly. This is verified by the lit tests `@while_data_partition`,
`@while_descriptor_data_partition`, and `@while_clc_data_partition` (the last
mirrors the CLC scheduler shape with `ttng.clc_advance`) in
`test/Hopper/WarpSpecialization/ws_while_loop_autows.mlir`.

`WSDataPartition` runs before `PartitionSchedulingMeta`, while the annotated
outer loop still exists. For a non-persistent schedule the subsequent
single-trip rewrite forwards AutoWS to the inner loop, so partition assignment
can continue there. Dynamic/CLC loops are not eliminated and remain gated on
the `PartitionSchedulingMeta` generalization described above. In other words:
the data-partition mechanism is ready for `while`; persistent while
partition-*assignment* is not.

> Known cosmetic artifact: data-partitioning a `while` leaves the original
> full-width dot as a *dead* loop result (not DCE'd, because removing a dead
> `scf.while` iter-arg needs while canonicalization). This is common to all
> `while` loops (the existing `@while_data_partition` test shows it too) and is
> harmless — the split slices are correct.

## Summary

- **Annotations are unified** across `for`/`while` via `AutoWSLoopOptions`; the
  frontend and IR emission are in lockstep, while the shared C++ registry owns
  their scheduler-loop propagation policy.
- **On `scf.for`** (including a static `while` uplifted to `for`): all
  annotations work.
- **On a non-persistent `scf.while`**: data partitioning sees the while before
  it is eliminated, then AutoWS is forwarded to the scheduled inner loop.
- **On a raw `scf.while`** (dynamic/CLC): the annotations attach and survive,
  `WSDataPartition` already understands `while`, but `warp_specialize` /
  `data_partition_factor` do not yet take effect end-to-end because
  `PartitionSchedulingMeta`/`ScheduleLoops` are `scf::ForOp`-typed. Tracked in
  [WarpSpecializeWhileLoops.md](WarpSpecializeWhileLoops.md).
