# AutoWS Overview

Automatic Warp Specialization (AutoWS) is a compiler optimization that
partitions a kernel's operations into specialized warp groups — typically a
**producer** group that handles memory loads and a **consumer** group that
handles computation (MMA/tensor core ops). By assigning different hardware
resources to each group, warp specialization enables overlap of memory
transfers, CUDA core work, and tensor core work, improving SM utilization.

## Pipeline

The AutoWS pipeline is defined in the adjacent `WarpSpecialization.cpp`. It
orchestrates sub-passes as function calls within a single monolithic pass:

```
doTaskPartition          (Hopper only; skipped on Blackwell)
  → doTaskIdPropagate
  → doDynamicTileBroadcast  (run-once tile-id: atomic counter + CLC fetch)
  → doDataPartition      (via nvgpu-ws-data-partition when requested)
  → doPingPongPrep       (optional, if pingpongAutoWS is set)
  → doBufferAllocation
  → doMemoryPlanner
  → doCodePartitionPost
  → doPingPongSync       (optional)
  → doTokenLowering
  → doLoopSchedulePreprocessing + scheduleLoops  (external, not in this directory)
```

On Blackwell, task assignments are expected to come from an earlier partition
scheduling pass (`PartitionSchedulingMeta`) rather than `doTaskPartition`.
Data partitioning is not Hopper-only; it can run as the separate
`nvgpu-ws-data-partition` pass when an explicit data partition factor or warp
group configuration requires per-consumer slices.

Before `PartitionSchedulingMeta`, the Meta WS backend runs
`nvgpu-sink-broadcast` to move `tt.broadcast` producer chains next to their
elementwise users. This keeps broadcasts and their value materialization, such
as a descriptor load followed by an extend, associated with their use after
other operands, such as TMEM loads, have been prepared.

## Register Budgets

`minRegAutoWS` and `maxRegAutoWS` control the per-thread register budgets used
when AutoWS assigns registers to non-tensor and tensor partitions. If either
knob is provided from the Python frontend, its value must be divisible by 8 so
the emitted register allocation matches the backend warp-group granularity.

## Persistent loops (`scf.for` and `scf.while`)

A static-persistent kernel's outer (tile) loop may be either an `scf.for` or an
`scf.while` (e.g. `while tile_id < num_tiles: ... tile_id += NUM_SMS`). Both are
first-class: warp-group cloning (`SpecializeWhileOp`), task-id propagation, data
partitioning, and barrier handling all accept `scf::WhileOp`. The cross-tile
accumulation-counter threading — seeding/carrying `accumCnt` through the while's
init operands, before/after block args, `scf.condition`, and `scf.yield`,
including the direct accumulator channel and reuse-group (subtiled-epilogue
staging) counters — is described in
[Accumulation Counters](AccumulationCounters.md#persistent-scfwhile-loops). The
redundant accumulator zero-store removal that avoids a cross-tile race also
recognizes the `scf.while` outer loop (same doc).

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Partition** | A group of operations assigned to run on the same warp group. Identified by a partition ID (integer). |
| **Async Task** | Synonym for partition. Identified by `async_task_id` attribute on ops. |
| **Channel** | A producer-consumer data dependency between partitions. Can be SMEM-backed (`ChannelPost`) or TMEM-backed (`TmemDataChannelPost`). |
| **Reuse Group** | A set of channels sharing a single physical buffer (`buffer.id`). See [ReuseGroups.md](ReuseGroups.md). |
| **Multi-buffering** | Allocating N copies of a buffer so the producer can fill copy N+1 while the consumer reads copy N. Controlled by `buffer.copy`. |
| **Operand D** | The MMA accumulator — the TMEM allocation that both receives MMA output and carries accumulated results across loop iterations. |
| **Ping-pong** | Named-barrier-based mutual exclusion between two consumer partitions executing expensive ops. |
| **Stage / Phase** | Pipeline stage index (which buffer slot) and phase (parity bit for mbarrier wait/arrive). |
| **Token** | Abstract synchronization primitive (`CreateTokenOp`) that is lowered to hardware mbarrier pairs. |
| **AccumCnt** | Accumulation counter — a loop-carried value that tracks the current buffer slot for multi-buffered channels. |
