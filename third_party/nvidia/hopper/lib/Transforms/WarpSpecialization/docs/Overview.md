# AutoWS Overview

Automatic Warp Specialization (AutoWS) is a compiler optimization that
partitions a kernel's operations into specialized warp groups — typically a
**producer** group that handles memory loads and a **consumer** group that
handles computation (MMA/tensor core ops). By assigning different hardware
resources to each group, warp specialization enables overlap of memory
transfers, CUDA core work, and tensor core work, improving SM utilization.

## Pipeline

The AutoWS pipeline is defined in the adjacent `WarpSpecialization.cpp`. It
orchestrates sub-passes as function calls within a single monolithic pass:

```
doTaskPartition          (Hopper only; skipped on Blackwell)
  → doTaskIdPropagate
  → doDynamicTileBroadcast  (run-once tile-id: atomic counter + CLC fetch)
  → doDataPartition      (via nvgpu-ws-data-partition when requested)
  → doPingPongPrep       (optional, if pingpongAutoWS is set)
  → doConvertDescriptorLoadsToNVWS
  → doBufferAllocation
  → doMemoryPlanner
  → doCodePartition
  → doPingPongSync       (optional)
  → doTokenLowering
  → doLoopSchedulePreprocessing + scheduleLoops  (external, not in this directory)
  → SoftwarePipeliner::lowerLoops
  → peelPartitionLoops   (first masked tile vs. unmasked remainder)
  → SoftwarePipeliner::expandLoops
```

On Blackwell, task assignments are expected to come from an earlier partition
scheduling pass (`PartitionSchedulingMeta`) rather than `doTaskPartition`.
Data partitioning is not Hopper-only; it can run as the separate
`nvgpu-ws-data-partition` pass when an explicit data partition factor or warp
group configuration requires per-consumer slices.

For a non-persistent unified scheduler, the single-trip `scf.while` is kept
through data partitioning and the initial loop schedule. The
`triton-simplify-single-trip-while` pass then forwards the outer AutoWS
attributes to the scheduled inner `scf.for` loop and inlines the while before
`PartitionSchedulingMeta` assigns partitions. Physical `ttg.warp_specialize`
regions are created later by `specializeRegion` during `doCodePartitionPost`.

Before `PartitionSchedulingMeta`, the Meta WS backend runs
`nvgpu-sink-broadcast` to move `tt.broadcast` producer chains next to their
elementwise users. This keeps broadcasts and their value materialization, such
as a descriptor load followed by an extend, associated with their use after
other operands, such as TMEM loads, have been prepared.

For explicitly enabled dependent 2-CTA matmul graphs, the backend runs
`nvgpu-analyze-2cta-dependencies` after matmul acceleration and before 2-CTA
descriptor-load rewriting. It follows the SSA chain into each collaborative
MMA and marks collective contractions separately from operands that require a
peer gather. `nvgpu-plan-2cta-exchange` then inserts an abstract gather before
buffer allocation. After AutoWS and software pipelining,
`nvgpu-materialize-2cta-exchange` reuses the planned dQ shared buffer for the
local and remote halves and lowers the gather to DSMEM stores and barriers.

The TMA store wait pipeline is enabled by default and can be disabled with the
`nvgpu-warp-specialization` pass option `tma-store-pipelining=false`. Disabling
it skips wait annotation, annotation validation, and wait reordering; it does
not disable early TMA store lowering.

## Register Budgets

`minRegAutoWS` and `maxRegAutoWS` control the per-thread register budgets used
when AutoWS assigns registers to non-tensor and tensor partitions. If either
knob is provided from the Python frontend, its value must be divisible by 8 so
the emitted register allocation matches the backend warp-group granularity.
Relay partitions contain no register-resident tensors, so they use the same
`minRegAutoWS` budget as other non-tensor partitions. A separate relay-specific
tuning knob can be added if future performance measurements justify one.

## Persistent loops (`scf.for` and `scf.while`)

A static-persistent kernel's outer (tile) loop may be either an `scf.for` or an
`scf.while` (e.g. `while tile_id < num_tiles: ... tile_id += NUM_SMS`). Both are
first-class: warp-group cloning (`SpecializeWhileOp`), task-id propagation, data
partitioning, and barrier handling all accept `scf::WhileOp`. The cross-tile
accumulation-counter threading — seeding/carrying `accumCnt` through the while's
init operands, before/after block args, `scf.condition`, and `scf.yield`,
including the direct accumulator channel and reuse-group (subtiled-epilogue
staging) counters — is described in
[Accumulation Counters](AccumulationCounters.md#persistent-scfwhile-loops). The
redundant accumulator zero-store removal that avoids a cross-tile race also
recognizes the `scf.while` outer loop (same doc).

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Partition** | A group of operations assigned to run on the same warp group. Identified by a partition ID (integer). |
| **Async Task** | Synonym for partition. Identified by `async_task_id` attribute on ops. |
| **Channel** | A producer-consumer data dependency between partitions. Can be SMEM-backed (`AllocChannel`) or TMEM-backed (`TmemAllocChannel`). |
| **Reuse Group** | A set of channels sharing a single physical buffer (`buffer.id`). See [ReuseGroups.md](ReuseGroups.md). |
| **Multi-buffering** | Allocating N copies of a buffer so the producer can fill copy N+1 while the consumer reads copy N. Controlled by `buffer.copy`. |
| **Operand D** | The MMA accumulator — the TMEM allocation that both receives MMA output and carries accumulated results across loop iterations. |
| **Ping-pong** | Named-barrier-based mutual exclusion between two consumer partitions executing expensive ops. |
| **Stage / Phase** | Pipeline stage index (which buffer slot) and phase (parity bit for mbarrier wait/arrive). |
| **Token** | Abstract synchronization primitive (`CreateTokenOp`) that is lowered to hardware mbarrier pairs. |
| **AccumCnt** | Accumulation counter — a loop-carried value that tracks the current buffer slot for multi-buffered channels. |
