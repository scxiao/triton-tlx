# Partition Scheduling Meta

This document covers the `PartitionSchedulingMeta` pass, which assigns partition
IDs to operations for warp specialization. This is the first pass in the AutoWS
pipeline — it determines which warp group each operation will execute on.

**File**: `PartitionSchedulingMeta.cpp`

## Overview

The pass walks all `scf.for` loops with the `tt.warp_specialize` attribute and
assigns each operation inside the loop (and post-loop consumers) to a
**partition**. Each partition maps to a warp group at runtime.

```
Phase 1: Categorize operations         (OpCategorizer + collectMMABackwardSlices)
Phase 2: Create partition layout       (createPartitionLayout with tuning knobs)
Phase 3: Schedule anchor ops           (loads, epilogue stores, MMAs)
Phase 4: Propagate users               (load users, correction, reductions)
Phase 5: Create computation partitions (per-MMA user scheduling + dpId assignment)
Phase 6: Schedule post-loop ops        (schedulePostLoopOps — epilogue routing)
  ─── end of getInitialSchedule ───
Post:    propagatePartitions + optimizeSchedule + splitDataPartitionedIfOps
```

## Tuning Knobs

Partition layout is controlled by `SchedulingOptions`, exposed as pass options
in `Passes.td`:

| Knob | Pass Option | Default | Effect |
|------|-------------|---------|--------|
| `mergeCorrection` | `--merge-correction` | false | Correction ops → computation[dpId] |
| `mergeEpilogue` | `--merge-epilogue` | false | Epilogue ops → correction/reduction/computation |
| `mergeEpilogueToComputation` | `--merge-epilogue-to-computation` | false | Epilogue ops → computation[dpId] directly |
| `mergeReduction` | `--merge-reduction` | false | Reduction ops → computation[dpId] |
| `separateEpilogueStore` | `--separate-epilogue-store` | false | Epilogue store ops → own 1-warp partition |

Per-loop `tt.merge_epilogue` attribute overrides the `mergeEpilogue` pass option.

### Epilogue Terminology

Post-loop operations are split into two categories:

- **Epilogue ops**: Non-store post-loop operations (tmem_load acc, normalize,
  truncf, convert_layout). These are computation that must happen after the
  main loop before the final store.
- **Epilogue store ops**: Post-loop TMA store operations (DescriptorStoreOp,
  AsyncTMACopyLocalToGlobalOp). These write the final results to global memory.

The epilogue tuning knobs control where these go:

**`mergeEpilogue` routing**: When true, epilogue ops go to the correction
partition (if it exists), else the reduction partition, else computation[dpId].
This preserves the priority: correction > reduction > computation. Used by
FA forward where epilogue ops (normalize acc) belong in the correction
partition.

**`mergeEpilogueToComputation` routing**: When true, epilogue ops go directly
to computation[dpId], even if a correction or reduction partition exists. This
is used by FA backward where post-loop ops (tmem_load dK/dV, reshape, split,
truncf) are data-partitioned and should stay with their corresponding
computation partition rather than being merged into the reduction partition.

`mergeEpilogueToComputation` takes priority over `mergeEpilogue` when both are
set.

Epilogue store ops are independent of these knobs — they always go to
`epilogue_store` (when `separateEpilogueStore`) or `epilogue` partition.

### Target Partition Layouts

| Case | Knobs | Partitions |
|------|-------|------------|
| Blackwell FA fwd | mergeEpilogue + separateEpilogueStore | correction, gemm, load, epilogue_store, comp×2 |
| Blackwell FA bwd | mergeEpilogueToComputation (merge_epilogue=true) | reduction, gemm, load, computation |
| Blackwell flex fwd | mergeEpilogue | correction, gemm, load, comp×2 |
| Hopper FA fwd | mergeCorrection + mergeEpilogue | load, comp×2 |
| Simple GEMM | separateEpilogueStore | gemm, load, epilogue, epilogue_store |
| No-MMA reduction (RMS/LayerNorm) | mergeEpilogue + separateEpilogueStore | reduction, load, epilogue_store |

The **No-MMA reduction** layout serves reduction-only kernels (RMS norm,
LayerNorm, softmax-only) that have **no MMA** and use a plain in-register
`tt.reduce` (not a TMA-atomic reduce). The `reduction` partition is the default
(index 0, 4 warps) and holds all tensor compute (square, `tt.reduce`,
accumulate, the rsqrt/normalize chain). The whole path is gated to
`mmas.empty()`, so MMA kernels — including the MMA-with-epilogue-reduction case —
are unaffected. Mechanics:

- **Trigger** (`OpCategorizer::hasComputeAnchorNoMMA`): `mmas.empty()` and the
  loop nest contains any `triton::ReduceOp`. Drives `hasComputeAnchor` in
  `createPartitionLayout`.
- **Reduction first → index 0**: the reduction branch fires for
  `hasReduction || hasComputeAnchor`, and because it runs before the
  load/epilogue_store branches it gets index 0 (the default 4-warp group), so
  `getDefaultPartition()` becomes non-null.
- **Phase 4 runs** (see the guard exception below): with `defaultPartition ==
  reductionPartition`, the load-user walk routes the in-loop tensor compute into
  the reduction partition (there is no Phase 5 for no-MMA kernels).
- **In-loop epilogue-store anchoring**: the generic anchoring keys on the
  non-store `epiloguePartition` (null here under `mergeEpilogue`), so a no-MMA
  gated step anchors in-loop epilogue store ops — the TMA store **and** its
  `async_tma_store_token_wait` — to `epilogue_store` *before* Phase 4. The
  staging `local_alloc` stays in reduction, forming the reduction→store SMEM
  channel.
- **Scalar-offset fixup**: before serialization, a no-MMA gated fixpoint assigns
  each still-unannotated value-producing op (e.g. `offs = i * 64`) the union of
  its partitioned users' ids (`muli` feeding both load and store gets both).
  These scalar ops are otherwise skipped by `propagatePartitions` yet must carry
  `ttg.partition` for the `tt.warp_specialize` verifier.

## Phase 1: Operation Categorization (`OpCategorizer`)

### Categories

| Category | Ops | Purpose |
|----------|-----|---------|
| `Load` | `DescriptorLoadOp`, `DescriptorGatherOp` | TMA loads |
| `MMA` | `MMAv5OpInterface`, `WarpGroupDotOp` | Tensor core operations |
| `MemDescView` | ops with `MemDescViewTrait` | Memory descriptor views feeding MMA |
| `EpilogueStore` | `DescriptorStoreOp`, `AsyncTMACopyLocalToGlobalOp` | Epilogue store ops (TMA output stores) |
| `TMAReduction` | `DescriptorReduceOp`, `AsyncTMAReduceOp` | Atomic reductions |
| `Correction` | Cross-iteration MMA users | Online softmax rescaling |
| `DataPartition` | Exclusive ops in one MMA's backward slice | Per-MMA-group computation |

### MMA Type Support

The pass supports both Blackwell and Hopper MMA types via the `isMMAOp()`
helper:
- **MMAv5** (`tc_gen5_mma`): Blackwell tensor cores. Gets its own `gemm`
  partition for TMEM-based accumulation.
- **WarpGroupDot** (`warp_group_dot`): Hopper tensor cores. No separate `gemm`
  partition — MMA ops go directly into computation partitions.

### Categorization Order

```
categorizeLoads()
categorizeMMAs()
categorizeEpilogueStores()
categorizeTMAReductions()
categorizeCorrectionOps()       ← runs before DataPartition
categorizeDataPartitionOps()    ← skips already-categorized ops
```

Correction runs before DataPartition so that correction ops (accumulator
rescaling) are not stolen by the data partition categorizer.

### Central dpId Assignment (`collectMMABackwardSlices`)

`collectMMABackwardSlices` is the single source of truth for data partition ID
(dpId) assignment. It:

1. **Collects backward slices** for each MMA, **entering `scf.if` regions**
   selectively — only following yield operands that correspond to results
   consumed by the current slice. This captures ops like `tmem_load QK` and
   `mulf(QK*scale)` in flex attention without pulling in ops from the other
   data partition.
2. **Groups dependent MMAs** via union-find. MMA B depends on MMA A if A's
   forward user set overlaps B's backward slice (e.g., QK MMA feeds PV MMA).
   The forward user set walk **escapes `scf.if` regions** by following
   `scf.yield` → the parent `scf.if`'s corresponding result (matched by yield
   operand index), mirroring how the backward slice selectively enters
   `scf.if`. Without this, a forward set that enters a causal-mask `scf.if`
   would dead-end at `scf.yield` (a terminator with no SSA results), fail to
   overlap the dependent MMA's backward slice, and leave QK/PV MMAs unmerged
   in separate computation partitions. Following the specific operand index
   (rather than the whole `scf.if`) keeps distinct data partitions separate
   for cases like flex attention.

   A **second union-find edge** groups MMAs that write the **same accumulator
   TMEM buffer**. Accumulator-chained MMAs (e.g. `dq += K0ᵀ·dS0` then
   `dq += K1ᵀ·dS1` into one `dq` tile, or `acc = A@B; acc += C@D`) form a serial
   reduction whose dependency flows through the accumulator memdesc/token, *not*
   an SSA result operand — so the forward-user-set walk above stops at each MMA
   and never sees it. Without this edge the chained dots would be counted as
   independent groups and split across partitions, racing on the shared tile.
   `getAccumulatorBuffer` resolves each MMA's accumulator to a canonical buffer
   identity: it stops at the backing `TMEMAllocOp`; traces through
   region/offset-preserving views only (`MemDescTransOp`, `MemDescReinterpretOp`);
   treats an offset-selecting `MemDescIndexOp` as its **own** identity (so two
   different-offset sub-tiles of one allocation are *not* collapsed); and bails
   to `nullptr` (logged) on any unrecognized producer rather than guessing.
3. **Builds `opToDpId` map** for ALL reachable ops:
   - **Inner-loop ops**: From backward slices, using normalized group IDs.
     Ops appearing in multiple groups get `SHARED_DPID` sentinel.
   - **Pre-loop ops**: Following MMA operands backward across the loop
     boundary (Q loads, allocs).
   - **Post-loop ops**: Following loop results forward to post-loop consumers
     (descriptor stores, normalization).

All `categorize*` functions look up dpId from `opToDpId` via `addCategorizedOp`,
which auto-resolves the dpId when not explicitly provided.

### Data Partition Factor Detection

1. **Collect backward slices** for each MMA.
2. **Identify shared ops** — ops appearing in multiple slices.
3. **Union-find grouping** — MMAs are grouped by two edges: (a) forward user
   sets that overlap another MMA's backward slice, and (b) writing the same
   accumulator buffer (`getAccumulatorBuffer`, see above). Edge (b) keeps
   accumulator-chained MMAs in one group even when no slice overlap exists.
4. **Count groups with exclusive ops** — only groups with at least one
   non-shared, non-constant op count. This becomes `dataPartitionFactor`.

For FA forward with `data_partition_factor=2`, this yields `dpFactor=2`.
For FA backward, MMAs are data-dependent (QK feeds PV via the same accumulator),
so all MMAs group together → `dpFactor=1`.

### Accumulator-chain backstop

After all partition assignments are finalized (post `propagatePartitions` +
`optimizeSchedule`, before serialization), a verification walk guards against
any assignment path — union-find above, preassignment, or flex — that splits a
shared tensor-memory accumulator across partitions that cannot be co-located.
Concurrent accumulating MMAs into one tile race and silently corrupt the
reduction, so this is turned into a **hard compile error** rather than a latent
accuracy bug.

The check maintains, per accumulator buffer, the **running intersection** of the
partition-id sets of every MMA that writes it, and errors the moment that
intersection becomes empty (no single partition is common to the whole chain).
This is correct for chains of 3+ writers: `{0,1},{0,2},{2,3}` is flagged (empty
overall intersection) while `{0,1},{0,2},{0,3}` passes on common partition `0`.
The diagnostic attaches a note pointing at the first MMA on the chain. The fix
is to co-locate the chain in one partition (lower `data_partition_factor`) or to
give each partition its own accumulator and reduce at the end.

## Phase 2: Partition Layout (`createPartitionLayout`)

Creates partitions based on the categorizer results and `SchedulingOptions`.

Partition creation order determines the partition index. The first partition
created gets index 0, which becomes the "default" warp group in
`tt.warp_specialize` (receives 4 warps):

1. **Correction** — when `!mergeCorrection && hasCorrection`. Serves as default
   for FA/flex (shared ops, load users go here). Created first → index 0.
2. **Reduction** — when `!mergeReduction && (hasReduction || hasComputeAnchor)`.
   Serves as default for bwd (TMA-atomic reduce) and for no-MMA in-register
   reduction kernels. `hasComputeAnchor` is true only when `mmas.empty()` and the
   loop contains a `tt.reduce` (`OpCategorizer::hasComputeAnchorNoMMA`), so it
   never fires for MMA kernels. Created first → index 0.
3. **Gemm** — only when MMAv5 ops exist (Blackwell). Hopper `warp_group_dot`
   is not MMAv5, so no gemm partition is created for Hopper.
4. **Load** — always.
5. **Epilogue** — when `!mergeEpilogue && !mergeEpilogueToComputation &&
   hasEpilogue`. Holds epilogue ops (non-store post-loop computation).
6. **Epilogue store** — when `separateEpilogueStore && hasEpilogue`. Gets 1
   warp. Holds epilogue store ops (TMA stores). When no separate epilogue store
   partition exists, epilogue store ops go to the epilogue partition instead.
7. **Computation** — pre-created in Phase 5 per data partition (reverse dpId
   order for consistent partition index assignment).

There is no dedicated "default" partition. Uncategorized ops (e.g., pre-loop
acc inits, shared ops, load users) that are not assigned by any phase are
routed to existing partitions with the fallback priority:
correction → reduction → epilogue → computation.

When merged (`mergeCorrection=true`), no correction partition is created and
those ops go to the next available partition in the fallback chain.

## Phase 3–5: Partition Assignment

### Phase 3: Anchor Ops

1. **Loads** → `load` partition. Includes `LocalAllocOp` users with matching
   shared encoding and `TMEMAllocOp` users.
2. **Epilogue store ops** → `epilogue_store` partition (when it exists), else
   follow the same routing as regular epilogue ops.
3. **MMAs** → `gemm` partition (MMAv5 only). Non-MMAv5 MMAs (WarpGroupDot) are
   left for Phase 5 where they go to computation partitions.
4. **MemDesc views** → `gemm` partition (MMAv5 only). Skipped when no gemm
   partition exists.

### Phase 4: Propagate Users

1. **Load users** → routed with the uncategorized op fallback priority:
   correction → reduction → epilogue → computation.
   **Guard**: When `defaultPartition == reductionPartition` (BWD case where
   no real correction/epilogue/computation partition exists yet), load-user
   scheduling is **skipped** to prevent transitively pulling the softmax
   chain into the reduction partition. Phase 5's MMA forward walk handles
   these ops instead. **Exception**: no-MMA reduction kernels (`mmas.empty()`)
   have no Phase 5, so the guard adds `|| mmas.empty()` and the load-user walk
   runs — it is exactly how the reduction (default) partition receives its
   tensor compute (square, `tt.reduce`, accumulate, normalize).
2. **Correction ops** → correction partition (+ `scheduleUsers` for transitive
   users). `scheduleUsers` walks **forward only** through the use chain
   starting from the correction-categorized op (the `tmem_load` of the PV
   accumulator). It claims all transitive forward users — reshape, trans,
   split, convert_layout, inline_asm (the mul with alpha), join, trans,
   reshape, convert_layout, tmem_store — for the correction partition.
   However, it does **not** walk backward to claim co-operands of visited ops.
   For example, when `inline_asm(mul %acc_split, %alpha_broadcast)` is
   claimed for correction, `scheduleUsers` does not trace back to
   `%alpha_broadcast` or `expand_dims %alpha`. These ops are left for
   Phase 5 (computation) and later `optimizeSchedule` (cloning).
3. **TMA reduction ops** → reduction partition (+ backward slice producers).

### Phase 5: Computation Partitions

Pre-creates computation partitions for each dpId that has `DataPartition`-
categorized ops (in reverse dpId order to match legacy partition index ordering).
Then iterates over MMAs (calling `scheduleUsers` to walk forward from each):

- **Pre-assigned MMAs** (PV MMAs): Use the pre-assigned computation partition.
- **Non-pre-assigned MMAs** (QK MMAs): First check user partitions, then look up
  dpId from `opToDpId` to find the correct existing computation partition. This
  prevents creating extra partitions.
- **Non-MMAv5** (Hopper): MMA ops themselves are scheduled into the computation
  partition (not gemm, since no gemm partition exists).
- **BWD (dpFactor≤1)**: All MMA users share one `sharedComputePartition`.
  `scheduleUsers` walks forward from each MMA: token result → tmem_load →
  subf/exp2/mulf → truncf → tmem_alloc/local_alloc, assigning all to computation.
- **3-loop causal**: MMAs in the second loop are matched to first-loop MMAs
  and `scheduleUsers` reuses their partition.

### dpId-Based Inner-Loop Assignment

After Phase 5, some inner-loop ops may remain unscheduled (e.g., `l_ij` reduce,
`tmem_alloc` p, `l_i*alpha`, `l_i+l_ij`). These ops have dpIds but aren't
reached by `scheduleUsers` because they're downstream of correction ops
(already scheduled in Phase 4) whose use chains `scheduleUsers` skips.

For each unscheduled inner-loop op with a tensor result:
1. Look up dpId from `opToDpId`.
2. If no entry, **trace through operands** to find the dpId from an operand
   that IS in `opToDpId` or already assigned to a computation partition.
3. Assign to the corresponding `dpIdToPartition` computation partition.

Scalar integer ops (loop counters) and `scf.yield` are excluded from this
assignment since they are loop-control ops, not data-partition computation ops.

### Phase 6: `schedulePostLoopOps`

Schedules post-loop operations (called at the end of `getInitialSchedule`,
before `propagatePartitions`):

- **Epilogue store ops** → `epilogue_store` partition (when it exists), else
  follow the same routing as regular epilogue ops.
- **Epilogue ops** (non-store) → routing depends on tuning knobs:
  - `mergeEpilogueToComputation`: → computation[dpId] directly
  - `mergeEpilogue`: → correction (if exists) → reduction → computation[dpId]
  - Neither: → `epiloguePartition` (if exists) → correction/reduction →
    computation

The `postLoopPartition` fallback order (for epilogue ops when no merge knob
is active) is:
1. `epiloguePartition` (when it exists)
2. Correction/reduction partition (whichever serves as default)
3. First `dpIdToPartition` entry (Hopper with all merges, last resort)

## Post-Processing

### `propagatePartitions`

Handles unscheduled ops by forming **clusters** — groups of adjacent
unscheduled ops connected via the SSA def-use graph. Each cluster tracks:

- **defPartitions**: Partitions of already-scheduled ops that feed into the
  cluster (upstream).
- **sinkPartitions**: Partitions of already-scheduled ops that consume the
  cluster's outputs (downstream).

**Nested loop visibility**: `iterateUsers` follows use chains into nested
inner loops to find partitioned consumers. When a captured value (e.g.,
`tt.splat` producing `tensor<!tt.ptr>`) is used inside a nested `scf.for`,
`iterateUsers` walks the use chain inside the nested loop until it finds an
op with a partition annotation. This ensures the cluster gets the correct
sink partition (e.g., computation) rather than falling back to the def
partition (e.g., reduction). Without this, `propagatePartitions` would
assign pointer tensor ops to reduction, creating cross-partition channels
for pointer types that crash `WSCodePartition`.

**Scalar op exclusion**: During cluster assignment, ops that produce only
scalar results (non-tensor, non-memdesc) are skipped. These ops can be
rematerialized in any partition and should not force partition assignment.
Clusters with empty `defPartitions` (containing only scalar ops) are also
skipped.

Cluster assignment rules:

1. **Multiple def or sink partitions**: The cluster sits between multiple
   partitions. For BWD-like kernels (has reduction, no epilogue, has
   computation), assign to the existing computation partition. Otherwise
   create a new computation partition (unless `createComputePartitions=false`,
   in which case merge into existing computation).
2. **No sink partition** (no downstream consumers with partitions): Assign
   the entire cluster to its def partition.
3. **Single def and single sink**: Assign to the sink partition (downstream
   consumer), or to the def partition if they're the same.

### `optimizeSchedule`

Clones cheap ops into each partition that has users. This rematerializes
metadata-only or layout-only ops in consumer partitions rather than creating
cross-partition channels.

**Cloneable ops**:
- `MemDescTransOp`: metadata-only reinterpretation of shared memory layout
- `ConvertLayoutOp`, `BroadcastOp`, `ExpandDimsOp`: cheap element rearrangement

**Not cloned**: `LocalAllocOp`. When a shared SMEM buffer (e.g., K/V in
Flash Attention) is consumed by ops in multiple partitions, the correct
model is a 1-producer to N-consumer channel: one TMA load writes the buffer,
all consumer partitions read from it. The downstream
`separateLocalAllocWithSrc` assigns the `local_store` the source op's
single task ID (the TMA load partition), and `createChannelPost` creates a
proper 1-to-N channel. This avoids buffer duplication and the SMEM it costs
(per-consumer copies pushed FA3 forward over H100's 228KB SMEM limit).

The cloning walks in reverse post-order so that an `ExpandDimsOp` feeding a
`BroadcastOp` is visited after the broadcast has already been cloned. When
`BroadcastOp` B is cloned into partition P (because B's user is in P), and
`ExpandDimsOp` E feeds B, then E is also cloned into P in the same pass
(because E's user — the cloned B — is now in P).

**Operand chain cloning**: After cloning a `BroadcastOp`/`ExpandDimsOp`,
`optimizeSchedule` walks backward through the clone's operand chain and
also clones any `ConvertLayoutOp`, `BroadcastOp`, or `ExpandDimsOp` that
feeds it from a different partition. This handles the case where upstream
layout passes insert a `ConvertLayoutOp` between `ExpandDimsOp` and
`BroadcastOp` (e.g., `expand_dims -> convert_layout -> broadcast`).

When a `MemDescTransOp` clone references a `LocalAllocOp` from a different
partition (e.g., `local_alloc -> memdesc_trans -> dot`), the backward walk
stops at the `LocalAllocOp` boundary. The `MemDescTransOp` clone keeps a
reference to the original shared alloc, which is correct because the alloc
is shared across partitions. The `separateLocalAllocWithSrc` pass later
assigns the producer task ID from the source op, creating a 1-to-N channel.

Without the backward walk, the cloned op would reference an operand in a
different partition, creating an unintended cross-partition boundary and
forcing the value through an smem channel instead of keeping it within the
partition.

### `splitDataPartitionedIfOps`

Splits `scf.if` ops whose results feed different computation partitions into
separate per-partition `scf.if` ops. Required for flex attention masking where
a single `scf.if` yields values for both data partitions.
