# Data Partitioning

Data partitioning physically splits tensor dimensions across multiple consumer
warp groups. After task assignment (which determines *which* ops run on
producers vs consumers), data partitioning determines *how* each consumer warp
group gets its slice of the data. For example, an M=256 accumulator is split
into two M=128 pieces for two consumer groups.

**File**: `WSDataPartition.cpp`
**Function**: `doDataPartition(funcOp, numConsumerGroups)`

## Pipeline Context

```
doTaskPartition          ← assigns ops to partitions
  → doTaskIdPropagate   ← propagates task IDs to all ops
  → doDataPartition     ← THIS STEP: splits tensor dimensions
  → doPingPongPrep
```

Data partitioning is exposed as `nvgpu-ws-data-partition` and is not Hopper
only. Hopper-style AutoWS typically reaches it after task ID propagation, while
Blackwell flows may run it as a separate pass when an explicit data partition
factor is attached or multiple warp groups require per-consumer slices.

## `DataPartitionScheme`

The central data structure tracking what to partition and how:

```cpp
struct DataPartitionScheme {
    unsigned numPartitions;                          // number of consumer groups
    SetVector<Operation *> ops;                      // ops to partition
    DenseMap<Operation *, unsigned> opPartitionDims;  // op → which dim to split
    DenseMap<Operation *, unsigned> dotPartitionOperand; // dot → which operand
    DenseMap<Operation *, SetVector<unsigned>> rematerializedOps; // ops to clone
    DenseSet<Operation *> opsToSkip;                 // ops exempt from partitioning
    DenseMap<unsigned, unsigned> funcArgPartitionDims; // func arg → partition dim
};
```

- `noOpPartitionDim`: Special sentinel value — ops with this dim are
  duplicated (cloned for each partition) rather than sliced.

## Algorithm

### Step 1: Task ID Fixup (`fixTaskId`)

Before partitioning, ensures all ops in def-use chains carry correct
`async_task_id` attributes via bidirectional propagation:

- **Backward**: If an op uses a value defined by an `arith` op that lacks the
  consumer's task ID, propagate backward.
- **Forward**: If a `YieldOp`, `ConditionOp`, `IfOp`, or `WhileOp` has a
  single-use operand whose defining op has extra task IDs, propagate forward.

Runs to a fixed point.

### Step 2: Compute Partition Scheme (`computePartitionScheme`)

Drives partitioning from dot/MMA ops:

1. Collect all `WarpGroupDotOp` operations and all operations implementing
   `MMAv5OpInterface`.
2. For each dot with multiple `async_task_id` values, determine the partition
   dimension from the accumulator shape:
   - **M dimension** (dim 0): if `shapePerCTA[0] / numPartitions >= 64`
   - **N dimension** (dim 1): if `shapePerCTA[1] / numPartitions >= 128`
   - M is preferred; N is fallback.
3. Call `getSliceToPartition` to trace the partition dimension through the
   dataflow graph.
4. Reject trial schemes that would require changing an existing TMEM encoding
   when partitioning along M. For example, splitting a `128x128` TMEM
   allocation with `blockM=128` into two `64x128` slices is rejected before any
   data partitioning rewrite; splitting `256x128` into `128x128` slices remains
   valid. This applies only to regular `TensorMemoryEncodingAttr` TMEM buffers;
   `TensorMemoryScalesEncodingAttr` scale buffers keep their scale encoding
   when sliced. When this guard fires, data partitioning is skipped and the
   function is otherwise left unchanged.

### Step 3: Slice Propagation (`getSliceToPartition`)

Traces the partition dimension backward and forward from the accumulator:

- **`getBackwardSliceToPartition`**: From the accumulator, walks backward
  through operand definitions. Tracks how the partition dimension transforms
  through transposes (`TransOp`), expands (`ExpandDimsOp`), reshapes, and
  other shape-changing ops. Stops at loads, block arguments, and ops that
  produce scalar types.

- **`getForwardSliceToPartition`**: From the accumulator, walks forward
  through result users. Handles `YieldOp` (follow to `scf.for` / `scf.if`
  results, or to the `scf.while` before-region backedge), `ConditionOp`
  (follow to `scf.while` results and after-region arguments), and tracks
  dimension remapping through layout-changing ops.

For `ReshapeOp` and `MemDescReshapeOp`, the pass remaps partition dimensions
by comparing flattened element intervals for each candidate source/destination
dimension. This permits reshapes such as:

```mlir
tensor<1x1x1x4x256xi8> -> tensor<256x4xi8>
```

to carry an M-dimension partition from logical scale dim 0 back to the packed
scale dimension. If no interval-preserving dimension exists, ordinary tensor
reshapes reject the partition trial; memdesc reshapes are allowed to become a
partition boundary, and the rewrite clones the full reshape before inserting a
`ttg.memdesc_subslice` on the reshaped result.

### Step 4: Rematerialization (`rewriteRematerializedOps`)

When an op is reached with **conflicting partition dimensions** (e.g., used by
two dots partitioning along different dims), it is marked for rematerialization.
Only `LocalAllocOp` and `arith::ConstantOp` are eligible. The op is cloned —
one copy per partition dimension — and users are updated to reference the
appropriate clone.

### Step 5: Rewrite (`sliceOp`)

For each partition offset (0 to `numPartitions - 1`):

1. Clone each partitioned op with types adjusted — divide
   `shape[partitionDim]` by `numPartitions`.
2. An op with `async_task_id = [1, 2]` gets split into two copies: one with
   `[1]` and one with `[2]`.
3. Function arguments with `TensorDescType` have their block type sliced to
   match the partition factor.

`ttg.local_load` is shape-preserving and can be sliced with the same simple
clone/retype path as `ttg.local_alloc`. This matters for scale paths that load
packed scale tiles from SMEM, reshape them into logical `(BLOCK_MN,
BLOCK_K / scale_vec_size)`, and then allocate scale TMEM for
`ttng.tc_gen5_mma_scaled`.

For `scf.while`, slicing may append extra loop-carried values. The new
before-region argument is forwarded through `scf.condition` to create the
matching while result and after-region argument, and the after-region
`scf.yield` appends the sliced next-iteration value.

### Step 6: Cleanup (`doDeepCleanup`)

After rewriting, runs dead code elimination and removes orphaned operations
that are no longer referenced after partitioning.

### Step 7: Conditional TMEM rescale materialization

FA forward represents its optional accumulator rescale as an eager SSA select
before tensor-memory allocation is hoisted. `HoistTMEMAlloc` first folds that
select into a predicated accumulator `TMEMStoreOp`. M partitioning creates one
scalar predicate and one accumulator view per partition. Partition scheduling
then co-locates the scalar predicate chain with the correction store. It also
pulls the single-consumer tensor elementwise predicate operation directly
feeding that chain, such as `alpha < 1`, into the correction partition while
leaving its tensor operands as channel boundaries. This makes the
already-required alpha value the channel boundary and avoids materializing a
redundant tensor predicate channel. After warp specialization and software
pipelining have materialized each task, the post-pipeline `HoistTMEMAlloc` pass
rewrites each such update as:

```mlir
scf.if %should_rescale {
  %acc = ttng.tmem_load %buffer
  %scaled = arith.mulf %acc, %alpha
  ttng.tmem_store %scaled, %buffer, %true
}
```

Delaying the rewrite until each task has been materialized keeps the
branch within the accumulator task instead of creating an unsupported
cross-task async-token channel. At that point synchronization is normally
barrier-managed and the TMEM ops are tokenless; if explicit tokens remain, the
then branch yields the written token and the else branch yields the incoming
token. The side-effecting branch cannot be canonicalized back to an eager
select, so a false predicate skips the accumulator TMEM load, arithmetic, and
store.

The scalar predicate walk reaches a store predicate through the
`partitionDependentScalar` mode of `getBackwardSliceToPartition`, which admits
elementwise ops, scalar constants, and a `ReduceOp` over the partitioned
dimension. A scalar leaf with no defining op is a block argument, and the two
kinds are not interchangeable: a `triton::FuncOp` argument is uniform across
partitions and is shared, matching `sliceOp`, which leaves function arguments
alone. Any other region argument — an `scf.for` iter-arg, or an `scf.if` /
`scf.while` carried value — may hold a partition-dependent value the walk
cannot see, and `sliceOp` would slice its entire parent region even though the
walk never registered it. Such a predicate rejects the partition trial rather
than leaving the analysis and the rewrite disagreeing.

## Key Design Points

### Partition Dimension Tracking

The partition dimension is tracked through shape-changing operations:
- `TransOp`: remaps dimension via permutation order
- `ExpandDimsOp`: shifts dimension index if expansion is before the partition
  dim
- `SplatOp`, `BroadcastOp`: partition dim propagates unchanged
- `MakeRangeOp`, `LoadOp`: stop — these produce fresh data

### TMEM accumulator writer slicing

Partitioning an in-place TMEM accumulator must also partition every operation
that establishes its initial contents and dependency token. In particular,
`getBackwardSliceToPartition` captures both writer forms:

- `TMEMCopyOp`, whose source partition dimension is remapped with
  `getTmemCopySrcPartitionDim`.
- `TMEMStoreOp`, such as the zero initialization of a loop-carried MMA
  accumulator, whose source uses the accumulator's partition dimension.

Leaving an initialization store unsliced is not merely dead data: its token can
remain threaded through the partitioned MMAs and keep the original full TMEM
allocation live. For example, HSTU self-attention forward partitions a
`256x128` PV accumulator into two `128x128` accumulators. The zero-init store
must be duplicated and sliced as well, so each partition receives its own
initial token and the full allocation can be removed.

When slicing a `TMEMStoreOp`, the pass may insert a TMEM-compatible
`ConvertLayoutOp` for that store. This conversion is private to the store. The
source value's natural sliced mapping is restored immediately afterward so
other partitioned users of the same value (such as an activation chain sharing
a zero splat) do not inherit the store-specific layout.

### Function Argument Slicing

When a `TensorDescType` function argument feeds a partitioned op, its block
type is sliced. The `funcArgPartitionDims` map tracks which arguments need
slicing and along which dimension.

If a `TensorDescType` function argument is also used as a loop init value, the
pass currently bails out. Updating both the function signature and the loop
carried argument/result types consistently requires additional handling.

### MMAv5 Scaled MMA

Scaled MMAv5 ops are partitioned through `MMAv5OpInterface` for the ordinary
MMA operands and accumulator. Scale operands are handled only for
`TCGen5MMAScaledOp`, because scale operands are not part of the generic MMAv5
interface.

The scale TMEM memdesc is treated logically as `(BLOCK_MN,
BLOCK_K / scale_vec_size)`. Therefore:

- M/output dim 0 partitioning slices `A` and `A_scale`; `A_scale` is sliced
  along logical scale dim 0.
- N/output dim 1 partitioning slices `B` and `B_scale`; `B_scale` is sliced
  along logical scale dim 0.
- Logical scale dim 1 is the K/scale-vector dimension and is not sliced by the
  normal M/N data partitioning path.

Scale buffers populated by `TMEMCopyOp` also need their copy source sliced to
match the destination scale rows. The copy source uses packed 32x128b chunks,
so the source partition dimension is the packed `repRows` dimension rather than
the logical scale dimension directly.

Scale buffers populated by `ttng.tmem_alloc %src` follow the same logical
partitioning rule. When the allocation result uses
`TensorMemoryScalesEncodingAttr`, slicing preserves that encoding instead of
trying to reinterpret it as a regular accumulator TMEM encoding. The compatible
distributed source layout is recomputed from the sliced scale memdesc type, so
the source tensor and destination scale TMEM agree after partitioning.

Example: a `BLOCK_M=256` scaled MMA with data partition factor 2 is rewritten
into two M partitions:

```mlir
%acc0, %tok0 = ttng.tmem_alloc
  : () -> (!ttg.memdesc<128x256xf32, #tmem, #ttng.tensor_memory, mutable>, !ttg.async.token)
%acc1, %tok1 = ttng.tmem_alloc
  : () -> (!ttg.memdesc<128x256xf32, #tmem, #ttng.tensor_memory, mutable>, !ttg.async.token)

%a0 = tt.descriptor_load ... : !tt.tensordesc<128x128xf8E4M3FN, ...>
%a1 = tt.descriptor_load ... : !tt.tensordesc<128x128xf8E4M3FN, ...>

%a_scale0 = ttng.tmem_alloc %scale0
  : (tensor<128x4xi8, ...>) -> !ttg.memdesc<128x4xi8, #tmem_scales, #ttng.tensor_memory>
%a_scale1 = ttng.tmem_alloc %scale1
  : (tensor<128x4xi8, ...>) -> !ttg.memdesc<128x4xi8, #tmem_scales, #ttng.tensor_memory>

ttng.tc_gen5_mma_scaled %a0, %b, %acc0[%tok0], %a_scale0, %b_scale, ...
  : !ttg.memdesc<128x128xf8E4M3FN, ...>,
    !ttg.memdesc<128x256xf32, #tmem, #ttng.tensor_memory, mutable>,
    !ttg.memdesc<128x4xi8, #tmem_scales, #ttng.tensor_memory>, ...
ttng.tc_gen5_mma_scaled %a1, %b, %acc1[%tok1], %a_scale1, %b_scale, ...
  : !ttg.memdesc<128x128xf8E4M3FN, ...>,
    !ttg.memdesc<128x256xf32, #tmem, #ttng.tensor_memory, mutable>,
    !ttg.memdesc<128x4xi8, #tmem_scales, #ttng.tensor_memory>, ...
```

### Interaction with Task IDs

Data partitioning operates **after** task ID assignment. The offset parameter
selects which task ID from the original array. This is how N consumer warp
groups each get their slice of the data.

### Partition-aware contraction schedules

Most `tt.autows` annotations are cloned unchanged, except for channel buffer
IDs, which are remapped to keep partitions disjoint. A two-group FA forward
pipeline additionally needs a partition-aware contraction order to safely
reuse its single-buffer QK tiles while overlapping adjacent iterations. The
frontend marks QK and PV contractions with `two_cta_interleave_role`; after
slicing gives each clone a concrete partition index, data partitioning emits:

```text
QK partition 0: stage 0, order 0
PV partition 1: stage 1, order 1
QK partition 1: stage 0, order 2
PV partition 0: stage 0, order 3
```

This puts `QK0`, `QK1`, and `PV0` in the prologue, matches TLX's steady-state
`QK0(next) -> PV1(previous) -> QK1(next) -> PV0(current)` issue order, and
leaves `PV1` in the epilogue. The rewrite is opt-in and only applies when there
are exactly two data partitions.

## Regression Tests

- `test/Hopper/WarpSpecialization/ws_data_partition_inplace_acc_token.mlir`
  covers an HSTU self-attention forward accumulator initialized before its
  loop. It checks that DP=2 produces per-partition `128x128` TMEM allocations
  and that no original `256x128` accumulator remains live through the shared
  token chain.
- `test/Hopper/WarpSpecialization/ws_data_partition_scaled_memdesc_reshape_reproducer.mlir`
  covers the positive `BLOCK_M=256` scaled-MMA case. It checks that M
  partitioning produces two `128x256` accumulator TMEM allocations, two
  `128x4` A-scale TMEM allocations, and two `tc_gen5_mma_scaled` ops with
  `128x128` A operands.
- `test/Hopper/WarpSpecialization/ws_data_partition_tmem_encoding_bail.mlir`
  covers the bailout path where M partitioning would slice regular accumulator
  TMEM below its `blockM=128` encoding, including a scaled-MMA
  `memdesc_reshape` reproducer.
