# Buffer Allocation

Buffer allocation is a pre-pass that discovers cross-partition channels,
creates or hoists SMEM and TMEM allocations to function scope, and
normalizes `local_alloc` ops for downstream code partitioning passes.

**File**: `WSCodePartition.cpp`
**Function**: `doBufferAllocation(funcOp)`
**Pass**: `NVGPUTestWSBufferAllocation`

## Pipeline Context

```
doTaskIdPropagate       ← assigns async_task_id to all ops
  → doConvertDescriptorLoadsToNVWS
  → doBufferAllocation  ← THIS STEP: channels + alloc hoisting
  → doMemoryPlanner     ← decides multi-buffering (buffer.copy)
  → doCodePartition ← inserts accumCnts, async copies, sync ops
```

`doBufferAllocation` creates single-copy buffers. Multi-buffering is
decided later by the memory planner. Code partitioning then uses
[accumulation counters](AccumulationCounters.md) to index into
multi-buffered allocations.

## Algorithm

### Step 0: `swapTransposedLocalAllocs`

When a `local_alloc` uses a transposed `#shared2` (NVMMAShared with
`transposed=true`) layout and its only use is a `memdesc_trans` back to
non-transposed `#shared` feeding MMA operand A, swap the layouts:

```
Before:  local_alloc → #shared_transposed  →  memdesc_trans → #shared
After:   local_alloc → #shared             →  memdesc_trans → #shared_transposed
```

This enables the alloc to share a buffer with other allocs of the same
source that already use `#shared` layout.

### Step 0.5: `mergeDuplicateLocalAllocs`

After layout normalization, merge `LocalAllocOp`s that have the same
source value and the same `MemDescType` — replace duplicates with the
first alloc.

### Step 0.75: `hoistDescriptorLoadBuffers`

Descriptor conversion has already replaced every `tt.descriptor_load` with a
buffer-writing `nvws.descriptor_load`. Trace each NVWS destination through
memdesc views to its backing `local_alloc` and hoist nested allocations to
function scope. This makes descriptor buffers canonical before remaining
tensor channels are discovered and before memory planning.

### Step 1: `collectAsyncChannels`

Walk the function to find cross-partition data dependencies. For each
operation with a single `async_task_id` that is a **channel anchor op**
(loads, dots, allocs with source, etc.), call `createChannel` to identify
consumers in different partitions. All channels are created with
`numBuffers=1` (single-buffered).

### Step 2: `reorderEpilogOps`

Reorder epilogue operations (stores after the main loop) to align with
the expected producer completion order. Groups stores by type
(`DescriptorStoreOp` vs `StoreOp`) and interleaves them so
earlier-completed producers are consumed first.

When an epilogue channel feeds a TMA store, the `DescriptorStoreOp` is the
ordering anchor for the consumer partition. Since `createBuffer` inserts
`LocalStoreOp` in producer order, this step preserves producer order within
each descriptor-store group so the producer-side `local_store` sequence
matches the TMA-store sequence.

### Step 3: `createBuffer`

The core step. For each channel (grouped by producer), create or hoist
the backing allocation to function entry:

- **TMEM channels** (existing `TMEMAllocOp` or `TCGen5MMAOp` source):
  Hoist the existing alloc to function entry via `hoistLocalAlloc`.

- **SMEM channels** (existing `LocalAllocOp` source):
  Hoist the existing alloc to function entry via `hoistLocalAlloc`.

- **Tensor-typed channels** (no existing alloc):
  Call `createLocalAlloc` which creates a new `LocalAllocOp` (SMEM)
  or `TMEMAllocOp` (for 1D tensors on Blackwell ≥ cc100), and also
  inserts a `LocalStoreOp` after the producer and a `LocalLoadOp`
  before the consumer.

Channels sharing the same producer value share the same buffer.

### Step 4: `separateLocalAllocWithSrc`

Split any remaining `local_alloc %val` (alloc-with-source) into
`local_alloc` + `local_store %val`. This normalization exposes
cross-partition SMEM dependencies as separate store ops, enabling
downstream `doCodePartition`/`doCodePartition` to detect them
as channels.

The `local_store`'s task ID determines the producer partition for the
channel. When the source is produced by a single-partition op (e.g. a TMA
`DescriptorLoadOp`), the store takes the source op's task ID rather than the
alloc's, which also carries consumer partitions from backward propagation.
This models a 1-producer to N-consumer channel — one TMA load writes the
shared buffer and every consumer partition reads it — instead of duplicating
the buffer per consumer.

Before buffer allocation, `doConvertDescriptorLoadsToNVWS` replaces every
`tt.descriptor_load` with a buffer-writing `nvws.descriptor_load`. A load whose
only user is `local_store` writes directly to that store's allocation. Other
loads, including bias loads followed by arithmetic, receive a descriptor-layout
SMEM allocation and a `local_load` preserving the original tensor uses. This
makes their transfer buffers visible to memory planning. No unconverted
descriptor load is allowed past this point.

## Key Distinction

`doBufferAllocation` does **not** insert:
- Accumulation counters (see [Accumulation Counters](AccumulationCounters.md))
- Async copies or TMA lowering
- Tokens or synchronization ops (barriers, acquire/release)

Those are handled by `doCodePartition` / `doCodePartition`.
