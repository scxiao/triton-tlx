# TMA Store Wait Pipeline

**File**: `WSTMAStoreLowering.cpp`, `WSMemoryPlanner.cpp`

After `doTMAStoreLowering` converts `tt::DescriptorStoreOp` into
`LocalAllocOp` + `AsyncTMACopyLocalToGlobalOp` + `TMAStoreTokenWaitOp`
(see [Memory Lowering](MemoryLowering.md#tma-store-lowering)), the
memory planner and a sequence of sub-passes handle these staging buffers.

Before this lowering, `doBufferAllocation` uses each `DescriptorStoreOp` as
the ordering anchor for channels feeding TMA stores. The producer-side
`local_store` order must match the descriptor-store order for the same TMA
descriptor; later wait annotation and rotation reason about the sequence of
stores to a shared staging buffer.

## Memory Planner: `buffer.tmaStaging` Handling

**File**: `WSMemoryPlanner.cpp` (within `allocateSmemBuffers`)

When `early_tma_store_lowering` is enabled, the `local_alloc` ops created
for TMA store staging are visible to the memory planner. Each WSBuffer is
classified by which TMA op it feeds (Phase 1):

```cpp
for (auto user : alloc->getUsers()) {
    if (isa<ttng::AsyncTMACopyLocalToGlobalOp>(user)) {
        buf.tmaStaging = 1;   // regular TMA store staging (dk, dv, c, o, ...)
        break;
    }
    if (isa<ttng::AsyncTMAReduceOp>(user)) {
        buf.tmaStaging = 2;   // TMA atomic-add reduce staging (dq, ...)
        break;
    }
}
```

`buf.tmaStaging` is a classification tag (0 = not TMA staging, 1 = store,
2 = reduce), not a count. It is propagated to the resulting `local_alloc`
op as the `buffer.tmaStaging` attribute and consumed by later passes that
need to distinguish reduce staging from regular store staging.

The flag drives a special path through three phases:

### Phase 3.5: TMA Staging Fusion

TMA staging WSBuffers are merged by descriptor and originating load (via
`fuseEpilogueWSBuffers`). If the originating load cannot be traced, as with
Hopper register accumulators, the producer task is used instead. For example,
the 4 same-task subtile stagings of `desc_dq` (under `EPILOGUE_SUBTILE=4`) all
share one `bufferId`, as do the dk and dv subtile stagings (each per their own
descriptor). Different data-partition tasks targeting the same descriptor stay
in distinct buffers.

The shared `bufferId` is honored by `doCodePartition` downstream: the
subtile allocs are physically merged into one `local_alloc` of shape
`numCopies x original_shape` (e.g., `1x128x32xf32` for `numCopies=1`).
All subtile stores then index into the same physical SMEM region via
`memdesc_index`. As a result `computeTotalSmem`'s cost model
(`max(size) × copies` per `bufferId`) matches the actual post-merge
physical footprint — there is no per-entry multiplier to add.

### Phase 3.6: Inter-Buffer SMEM Reuse via `allocation.reuseTarget`

When the post-Phase-3.5 SMEM total still exceeds `smemBudget`,
the planner runs an inter-buffer reuse pass (`Phase 3.6: Reuse
allocated buffers when base total exceeds budget` in
`WSMemoryPlanner.cpp::allocateSmemBuffers`). It looks for a host
buffer whose physical SMEM region can be overlapped with a staging
buffer's region without a liveness conflict (the host's last consumer
finishes before the staging's first store), and annotates the staging
alloc with `allocation.reuseTarget = <host bufferId>`. The annotated
WSBuffer's footprint is then counted against the host's region in the
planner's `computeTotalSmem` accounting (i.e. it costs 0 extra bytes
as long as `max(host, staging × copies)` fits inside the host's
existing allocation).

Concrete example for FA-bwd: with `_BWD_DOT_ATTRS_TMEM` and
`BLOCK_M1=128`, the planner annotates

```mlir
%desc_dv_staging = ttg.local_alloc {
  allocation.reuseTarget = 3 : i32,   // v's buffer.id
  buffer.copy = 2, buffer.id = 22, buffer.tmaStaging = 1
} : () -> !ttg.memdesc<128x64xf16, #shared, #smem, mutable>

%desc_dk_staging = ttg.local_alloc {
  allocation.reuseTarget = 4 : i32,   // do's buffer.id
  buffer.copy = 2, buffer.id = 24, buffer.tmaStaging = 1
} : () -> !ttg.memdesc<128x64xf16, #shared, #smem, mutable>
```

so that the planner can keep both staging groups at `numCopies=2`
inside the 220 KB budget by treating them as "free" (they share v's
and do's 32 KB regions respectively).

**Important:** the planner sets the attribute and accounts for the
reuse, but the SMEM layout pass (`AllocateSharedMemoryNv`) does *not*
read `allocation.reuseTarget` directly — it sees the staging alloc as
a request for its own region. Realizing the reuse therefore requires
an extra step in `doCodePartition` that rewrites the staging alloc
into a reinterpret view of the host alloc (see
[CodePartition: Realizing `allocation.reuseTarget`](#code-partition-realizing-allocationreuetarget)
below).

### Phase 3.7: Epilogue Group Copy Increase

Each fused P2_Other group (including TMA staging groups) is treated as
an epilogue group. `increaseFusedEpilogueCopies` iteratively bumps
`numCopies` from the current value up to `numBuffers`, accepting each
bump as long as `computeTotalSmem ≤ smemBudget`.

This reservation runs before the general Phase 4 P0/P1 copy increase. TMA
store/reduce staging is on the output critical path and must get first claim on
the discretionary budget; otherwise small operand buffers can consume the last
few KiB before a high-value staging ring (for example FA-bwd dQ) is considered.

TMA-fed operands of a compiler data-partitioned MMA loop with
`tt.disallow_acc_multi_buffer` are not discretionary: before Phase 3.7, the
planner pins them to the configured pipeline depth. Their acquire/release
schedule assumes that depth, and shortening the ring can overwrite an operand
while a partitioned, pipelined MMA still consumes it.
Phase 3.7 therefore reserves output staging only from the budget remaining
after these operand correctness floors. Ordinary single-group MMA operands and
TMA-fed metadata used only by elementwise computation remain discretionary, so
FA-backward dQ/dK/dV staging stays prioritized over their extra copies.

Groups whose members all reuse another allocation (`isAllocated=false`) are
bumped only when every Phase 3.6 host has enough physical capacity for the
enlarged ring (`stagingSize × copies ≤ hostSize × hostCopies`). Their apparent
cost in `computeTotalSmem` is zero, so omitting this capacity check makes an
increase look free even when reuse realization must reject the alias and
materialize a separate allocation, which can make the final physical layout
exceed the planner budget.

#### `K | S` cap for same-partition (wait_group-drained) staging

A staging group holds **S** subtiles (`S = indices.size()`, the fused
`EPILOGUE_SUBTILE` / `DQ_SUBTILE` stores) that rotate through **K =
numCopies** slots. How the buffer is drained — and therefore which K values
are *correct* — depends on the channel's producer/consumer topology:

- **Same-partition staging** (producer and consumer in the same warp task,
  e.g. bwd `dk`/`dv`/`dq`): drained only by `cp.async.bulk.wait_group(K-1)`,
  with the per-tile slot `theIdx % K` (see `getStaggeredAccumCnt`). The fixed
  in-flight-count wait is correct only if same-slot stores are exactly K apart
  across the tile boundary, i.e. **K must divide S**. A non-dividing K (e.g.
  `K=3, S=4`, or `K > S`) makes a store clobber a slot before it drains →
  wrong gradients, with nothing downstream to catch it.
- **Cross-partition staging** (producer task ≠ consumer task, e.g. fwd
  `desc_o`): the slot/phase come from a continuous `accumCnt` producer/consumer
  mbarrier rotation and tolerate **any** K.

Phase 3.7 therefore detects same-partition staging via
`getAsyncTaskIds(ch->getSrcOp()) == getAsyncTaskIds(ch->getDstOp())` and, for
those groups, only accepts a `tryCopies` that divides S (others are skipped).
This is a **defensive backstop**: in all shipped configs `num_stages = 2` and
`S ∈ {2,4}`, so `K | S` already holds and the cap is a no-op — it exists to
keep a future `num_stages`/subtile combination from silently violating the
rotation invariant. The cross-stage floor (`WSBuffer::minCopies`) is a hard
correctness floor and is never reduced; if it itself violates `K | S` for a
wait_group ring the pass emits an `LDBG` warning rather than dropping below it.

`computeTotalSmem` accounts for the active `buffer.id` groups using
`max(size) × copies` per ID. For TMA store staging groups this matches the
planner's reuse model, but the downstream physical allocation still leaves
each staging alloc as a separate op.

### Combined SMEM Cost

If the planner needs an exact hardware-SMEM accounting pass for TMA store
staging, the cost needs per-entry accounting because the allocs are NOT merged
into one physical alloc downstream:

```
tmaStoreSmem = numEntries * size * copies
```

### Phase 6: Hoist Before Outermost Loop

All TMA staging allocs are moved before the outermost enclosing
`scf.for` loop. This is required for the rotation mechanism
(`doAnnotateTMAStoreWaits`) which reads `buffer.copy` and only annotates
allocs that are outside all loops.

## Wait Annotation and Reordering Pipeline

Within the AutoWS monolithic pass (`WarpSpecialization.cpp`), three
functions handle the wait ops after the memory planner:

```
doMemoryPlanner
  → doAnnotateTMAStoreWaits      ← annotate waits with buffer count
  → doValidateTMAStoreAnnotations ← safety check
  → doCodePartition
  → ...
  → scheduleLoops                 ← SWP assigns pipeline stages
  → cleanupWarpSpecializedLoops   ← prune dead loop-carried values
  → doTMAStoreWaitReorder         ← move waits using the SWP schedule
```

This sequence is controlled by the `nvgpu-warp-specialization` pass option
`tma-store-pipelining`, which defaults to `true`. When set to `false`, AutoWS
skips all three steps: annotation, validation, and post-schedule reordering.
This option is independent of `early_tma_store_lowering`, which controls
whether descriptor stores are lowered into async TMA store operations before
warp specialization.

Each function is also available as a standalone MLIR pass for use outside
the monolithic pipeline.

## Step 1: `doAnnotateTMAStoreWaits`

**Test pass**: `nvgpu-test-annotate-tma-store-waits` (`NVGPUTestAnnotateTMAStoreWaitsPass`)

This pass inspects every `TMAStoreTokenWaitOp` enclosed by an `scf.for` loop
or an `scf.while` loop containing a CLC scheduler operation. Atomic dynamic-
persistent loops are deliberately excluded even though they use the same SCF
operation: their next iteration may represent unrelated work, so rotating an
epilogue wait across that boundary can race staging-buffer reuse.
The pass marks CLC loops with `ttg.clc_persistent` before code partitioning so
the per-partition loop clones remain identifiable after the CLC operations are
isolated in the scheduler partition.
For each wait, it traces the token back to the defining
TMA store-like op (`AsyncTMACopyLocalToGlobalOp` or `AsyncTMAReduceOp`),
then looks at the SMEM buffer used by that store:

1. Get the `LocalAllocOp` that produces the buffer.
2. Read the `buffer.copy` attribute (set earlier by the memory planner),
   which records how many physical copies of this buffer exist.
3. If `buffer.copy = K`, set `can_rotate_by_buffer_count = K` on the wait op.

The attribute means: "K buffer copies exist, so this wait can be delayed
until the K-th subsequent TMA store to the same buffer — at that point
the buffer slot is about to be overwritten and the earlier store must
have finished reading."

After the reorder is successfully realized, the pass records
`planned_pending_count = K - 1` as stable lowering metadata for the equivalent
`cp.async.bulk.wait_group(K-1)` protocol. Delaying this metadata prevents a
failed or skipped rotation from changing the original wait semantics.
Software-pipeline schedule serialization can move token waits through clusters
without retaining enough linear IR context to reconstruct K reliably; final
wait lowering therefore uses this explicit count when present and falls back
to program-order counting for unplanned waits.

### Token Tracing

`getDefiningTMAStoreOp` handles two cases:

| Case | Pattern |
|------|---------|
| **Direct** | Token is the direct SSA result of `AsyncTMACopyLocalToGlobalOp` or `AsyncTMAReduceOp` |
| **Loop-carried** | Token is a block argument of the `scf.for` body; the function follows the corresponding yield operand back to its `AsyncTMACopyLocalToGlobalOp` or `AsyncTMAReduceOp` |

## Step 2: `doValidateTMAStoreAnnotations`

This is a safety pass that runs immediately after annotation. It
re-checks every annotated wait and strips the `can_rotate_by_buffer_count`
attribute if the defining TMA store or its `LocalAllocOp` can no longer
be resolved. This guards against IR transformations between annotation
and reordering that might invalidate assumptions.

## Step 3: `doTMAStoreWaitReorder`

**Test pass**: `nvgpu-test-tma-store-token-wait-reorder` (`NVGPUTestTMAStoreTokenWaitReorderPass`)

This pass runs **after** `scheduleLoops` has assigned pipeline stages and
clusters to every op. It uses the SWP `CoarseSchedule` to move waits
forward in the linearized pipeline order.

Straight-line epilogues use the same reuse-point rule without a coarse
schedule. A direct-token wait moves to immediately before the next
`local_store` that feeds any TMA store in the block. TMA `wait_group` is
queue-wide rather than descriptor- or allocation-specific, so the final wait
for one output (for example dV) may cross independent preparation for the next
output (dK) and stop at dK's staging write. The last wait in the block remains
the final drain.

CLC epilogues are straight-line regions inside the persistent scheduler's
`scf.while`. Their annotated waits retain `planned_pending_count = K - 1`, so
the K-slot staging ring overlaps stores across scheduler iterations. Because
the loop can terminate with stores still pending, the pass emits one
queue-wide `wait_group(0)` after the `scf.while` for every issuing async task.
This is the CLC counterpart of the post-`scf.for` drain used by merged
epilogues.

For annotated operations, merged epilogue loops
(`tt.merge_epilogue_to_computation`) serialize the
same-iteration part of the coarse schedule directly into block order: the pass
selects the nearest matching writer before the chosen future TMA operation, so
a two-slot dQ ring maps store 0's wait to store 2 rather than the earlier
equivalent slot-0 writer. These loops are intentionally not expanded by the GPU
pipeliner. Barrier-free wraparound token waits are therefore materialized as
queue-wide `wait_group(K-1)` operations before the next iteration's staging
writers, followed by one `wait_group(0)` drain after the loop. Ordinary
software-pipelined loops retain their loop-carried token schedule.

The merge attribute can be on an enclosing persistent loop rather than the
loop containing the dQ stores. The pass therefore searches the loop ancestry:
an inner reduction loop inherits the merged-epilogue realization and receives
its final drain immediately after that inner loop. Checking only the immediate
loop leaves loop-carried token waits in final TTGIR and loses the drain.

### Algorithm

For each annotated `TMAStoreTokenWaitOp` with `can_rotate_by_buffer_count = K`:

1. **Deserialize the schedule** from the `scf.for` loop. If no schedule
   exists, create a trivial single-stage schedule so the logic can still
   proceed.

2. **Linearize from the defining TMA store**: use
   `schedule.linearized(forOp, tmaStore)` to get an iterator that walks
   ops in pipeline-unrolled order (wrapping across stages up to
   `numStages + K`). Note: That we may only increase by 1 stage (we move
   by K TMA stores, not necessarily K pipeline stages).

3. **Count K stores**: walk the linearized schedule, counting
   `AsyncTMACopyLocalToGlobalOp` and `AsyncTMAReduceOp` ops. Stop at the K-th
   store-like op — this is the point where the buffer slot would be reused.

4. **Adjust for barriers**: scan backwards from the insertion target to
   find a preceding `WaitBarrierOp`. If one exists, insert before it
   instead — this avoids placing the TMA store wait between a barrier
   wait and the ops it guards.

5. **Update the schedule**: split the cluster at the insertion target and
   create a new cluster for the wait op, assigned to the target's pipeline
   stage. Serialize the modified schedule back to the loop.

6. **Remove the annotation**: strip `can_rotate_by_buffer_count` from the
   wait op.

### Example

With `buffer.copy = 2` (double-buffered) and a 3-stage pipeline:

```
Stage 0: AsyncTMACopyLocalToGlobal (store to buffer[0])
         TMAStoreTokenWait          ← originally placed here
Stage 1: ...compute...
Stage 2: AsyncTMACopyLocalToGlobal (store to buffer[1])
```

After reordering with K=2, the wait moves forward to just before the 2nd
copy (which would overwrite buffer[0]):

```
Stage 0: AsyncTMACopyLocalToGlobal (store to buffer[0])
Stage 1: ...compute...
Stage 2: TMAStoreTokenWait          ← moved here
         AsyncTMACopyLocalToGlobal (store to buffer[1])
```

This allows the compute in stage 1 to overlap with the asynchronous TMA
store instead of stalling.

## Final Lowering: `NVGPUTMAStoreTokenWaitLoweringPass`

**Pass**: `nvgpu-tma-store-token-wait-lowering`

After reordering, a separate pass lowers each `TMAStoreTokenWaitOp` into
concrete hardware operations:

1. **Compute pendings**: count TMA store-like ops
   (`AsyncTMACopyLocalToGlobalOp` or `AsyncTMAReduceOp`) between the
   defining store and the wait (in program order). For loop-carried
   tokens, this wraps around the loop body boundary.
2. **Emit `TMAStoreWaitOp`**: waits until at most `pendings` TMA stores
   remain in flight.
3. **Emit `ArriveBarrierOp`**: for each barrier attached to the wait,
   signals that the SMEM buffer is now free for reuse.
4. **Erase** the original `TMAStoreTokenWaitOp`.

See also [Memory Lowering](MemoryLowering.md) for the broader context of
how TMA stores fit into the WS memory lowering pipeline.

## Code Partition: Realizing `allocation.reuseTarget`

**File**: `WSCodePartition.cpp::doCodePartition`

The planner's `allocation.reuseTarget = N` annotation is a SMEM-accounting
hint. To actually realize the SMEM overlap in the emitted kernel, two
coordinated steps are required inside `doCodePartition` before the layout
pass (`AllocateSharedMemoryNv`) runs:

### Step 1: Insert the Cross-Tile Reuse WAR Barrier (Step 7.5)

Because the staging buffer aliases the host operand SMEM, the **next tile's
operand load** must not overwrite that SMEM until the **previous tile's staging
TMA store** has finished reading it. Step 7.5 emits a dedicated, single-buffered
cross-partition token for this write-after-read edge:

- the **load task** does a `producer_acquire` at the **top of the persistent
  outer loop** (before the operand loads), and
- the **staging task** does a `consumer_release` at the **bottom of the outer
  loop** (after the staging stores, which have already drained).

Both are loop-carried (phase derived from the outer-loop induction variable via
`getBufferIdxAndPhase`), so the edge serializes `load(tile N+1)` after
`staging-store(tile N)`. The load and staging genuinely alias the same SMEM, so
this serialization removes no legitimate overlap.

```mlir
scf.for %tile = ... {
  nvws.producer_acquire %reuse_token, %idx, %phase   // load task, top
  ... operand loads (v/do) ...
  ... MMAs, epilogue, dv/dk staging stores + async_tma_store_token_wait ...
  nvws.consumer_release %reuse_token, %idx           // staging task, bottom
  scf.yield
}
```

**Why a dedicated token (not the host operand's own barrier).** The host
operand buffer's empty barrier is released by its MMA consumer, which finishes
*before* the staging store — too early. It also cannot carry an extra release
from the staging task: the staging task and the MMA task have different warp
counts, which trips the `consumerWarps == nWarps` assert in `WSLowerToken`. A
separate token has a uniform consumer (the staging task), avoiding the conflict.

**Earlier (degenerate) design — fixed.** Step 7.5 previously emitted a
`producer_acquire` on the *host* token before the staging store, with constant
`bufferIdx = 0` / `phase = 0`. That gated the wrong direction (the staging
*write* after the host read, which the dv/dk accumulator-complete wait already
covers) and, with a constant phase, never alternated across the persistent loop
— a no-op. It happened to be harmless on the non-persistent (single-tile) path
but left the persistent path with a cross-tile SMEM race (non-deterministic
wrong dv/dk gradients). The cross-tile WAR token above replaces it. Regression
coverage: `test_bwd_tmem_dsT_reuse_3group_persistent`.

**Important ordering constraint**: this insertion **must** run **before**
`insertAsyncComm`, whose cleanup sweep (`removeTokenfNotUsed`) erases any token
alloc currently lacking users — the freshly-created reuse token only gains uses
once the acquire/release are inserted. This is enforced as "Step 7.5" — running
between `createToken` (Step 7) and `insertAsyncComm` (Step 8). See commit
`c67893c25` for the related ordering bug-fix.

### Step 2: Reinterpret Staging Alloc into Host Alloc

After Step 7.5 makes the cross-partition timing safe, the staging
`local_alloc` is **replaced** by a `memdesc_reinterpret` view of the
host alloc. All uses of the staging memdesc (TMA copy/reduce ops,
`memdesc_index` for rotation, `local_store`, etc.) are rewritten to
reference the reinterpret view, and the original staging alloc is
erased.

This is analogous to the TMEM path in the existing `replaceBufferReuse`
(which uses `sliceAndReinterpretMDTMEM` to overlay multiple TMEM
allocs into one region — see
[ReuseGroups.md §3 Buffer Replacement](ReuseGroups.md#3-buffer-replacement)),
extended to SMEM:

```mlir
# Before:
%v             = ttg.local_alloc : () -> !ttg.memdesc<128x128xf16, #shared>
%dv_staging    = ttg.local_alloc {allocation.reuseTarget = 3}
                                 : () -> !ttg.memdesc<2x128x64xf16, #shared>
... %dv_staging uses ...

# After:
%v             = ttg.local_alloc : () -> !ttg.memdesc<128x128xf16, #shared>
%dv_staging.view = ttg.memdesc_reinterpret %v
                  : !ttg.memdesc<128x128xf16> -> !ttg.memdesc<2x128x64xf16>
... %dv_staging.view uses ...
# (original %dv_staging is erased)
```

The reinterpret is sound because the host alloc's storage covers at
least `staging.size × staging.numCopies` bytes (this is exactly the
condition `findReuseCandidate` checks when picking a target).

### Why both steps are necessary

| Step omitted | Symptom |
|---|---|
| Step 1 (cross-partition barrier) | Race: staging writer can clobber the host region while the host's consumer is still reading. |
| Step 2 (reinterpret merge) | `AllocateSharedMemoryNv` places staging at a fresh offset (it has no awareness of `allocation.reuseTarget`), so the planner's "free" accounting is wrong: actual SMEM usage = planner total + Σ(staging × copies). For FA-bwd idx=2 / idx=0 this gap is ~64 KB and pushes the kernel over B200's 232 KB SMEM ceiling at codegen time. |
