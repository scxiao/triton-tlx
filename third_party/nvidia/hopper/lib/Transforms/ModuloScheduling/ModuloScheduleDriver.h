// Shared driver for the modulo-scheduling pass family.
//
// ModuloSchedulePass (heuristic backends, env-selected) and
// JointSolverSchedulePass (joint solver: schedule + warp partition) are thin
// shells over the same orchestration: collect loops → schedule → global
// warp-group partition → emit loop.stage/loop.cluster + buffer annotations.
// ScheduleDriverOptions is the ONLY behavioural difference between them, so
// both passes stay in lockstep on everything downstream consumes.
