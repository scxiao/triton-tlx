# TorchTLX

We introduce torchTLX to boost PT2 performance by pushing TLX primitives deeper into inductor template and fusion infra.

This work runs in parallel with our ongoing Triton compiler investments. TorchTLX lets us rapidly validate hardware-specific optimizations and bring forward wins while feeding proven techniques back to the Triton compiler.

## Overview

PT2 flows through Dynamo for graph capture and Inductor for optimization and code gen. Within Inductor, a scheduler decides which operations to fuse and then delegates to a backend-specific codegen engine, selecting among template candidates (Triton/CUTLASS) and cuBLAS via autotuning.

However, low-level hardware primitives such as tile shapes, warp spec roles and TMA directionality are invisible to the scheduler, limiting its ability to leverage modern GPU architecture when making fusion decisions.

Meanwhile, standalone TLX matmul kernels are matching or slightly exceeding cuBLAS. Unlike opaque cuBLAS kernels, a TLX kernel at parity opens the door to richer epilogue fusions.

In summary, torchTLX integrates TLX as a low-level backend for Inductor, introducing significant changes to template selection, fusion logic and kernel codegen.

## TorchTLX Templates

TorchTLX templates are jinja-based kernel definitions that encode our best-performing TLX kernels into Inductor's template infra. We have shipped a GEMM template targeting Blackwell, with a flex attention template in active development. The underlying TLX GEMM kernel incorporates a series of hardware optimizations: warp specialization, CLC-based persistent execution, multi-CTA cooperation, epilogue subslicing, data partitioning and dynamic split-K.

Our performance strategy operates on two parallel tracks: improving standalone TLX kernels upstream and closing any remaining gap when running through the Inductor template path.

## TorchTLX Fusions

TorchTLX supports epilogue fusion through two store mechanisms.
Inductor's standard epilogue fusion works out of box when a TLX templated kernel uses tl.store. The scheduler detects fusible downstream ops (e.g., bias add, ReLU) and injects them into the template's `{{store_output}}` hook at codegen time.

```
                        tlx.barrier_arrive(tmem_empty_bars[buf_idx], 1)
                        offs_cn = offs_bn + slice_id * slice_size
                        _tmp_var1 = offs_am
                        _tmp_var0 = (_tmp_var1 + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_M_SPLIT))[:, None]
                        _tmp_var2 = _tmp_var0 < 4096
                        _tmp_var4 = offs_cn
                        _tmp_var3 = (_tmp_var4 + tl.arange(0, slice_size))[None, :, ]
                        _tmp_var5 = _tmp_var3 < 4096
                        _tmp_var6 = _tmp_var2 & _tmp_var5
                        xindex = _tmp_var3 + 4096*_tmp_var0
                        tmp0 = tl.load(in_ptr2 + (tl.broadcast_to(xindex, [BLOCK_M_SPLIT, slice_size])), _tmp_var6, eviction_policy='evict_last').to(tl.float32)
                        tmp1 = result + tmp0
                        tmp2 = tl.full([1], 0, tl.int32)
                        tmp3 = triton_helpers.maximum(tmp2, tmp1)
                        tl.store(out_ptr1 + (tl.broadcast_to(xindex, [BLOCK_M_SPLIT, slice_size])), tmp3, _tmp_var6)
```

For templates using tlx.async_descriptor_store, we introduce compute_epilogue to run the fused epilogue ops and assign the result to a variable, letting the template manually stage through SMEM and issue async_descriptor_store to preserve the async pipeline overlap with MMA warps.

```
                        tlx.barrier_arrive(tmem_empty_bars[buf_idx], 1)
                        offs_cn = offs_bn + slice_id * slice_size
                        xoffset = offs_am
                        xindex = (xoffset + tl.arange(0, XBLOCK))[:, None]
                        xmask = xindex < 4096
                        yoffset = offs_cn
                        yindex = (yoffset + tl.arange(0, YBLOCK))[None, :, ]
                        ymask = yindex < 4096
                        fused_c = result
                        tmp0 = tl.load(in_ptr2 + (yindex + 4096*xindex), None, eviction_policy='evict_last').to(tl.float32)
                        tmp1 = result + tmp0
                        tmp2 = tl.full([1, 1], 0, tl.int32)
                        tmp3 = triton_helpers.maximum(tmp2, tmp1)
                        fused_c = tmp3
                        c_smem = c_smem_buffers[(group_id * EPILOGUE_SUBTILE + slice_id) % NUM_EPILOGUE_SMEM_BUFFERS]
                        tlx.async_descriptor_store_wait(1)
                        tlx.local_store(c_smem, fused_c.to(A.dtype.element_ty))
                        tlx.fence_async_shared()
                        tlx.async_descriptor_store(desc_c, c_smem, [offs_am, offs_cn], eviction_policy="evict_first")
```

## Vision for Next-gen Hardware

As new GPU architectures arrive, torchTLX offers two key advantages.

First, it streamlines access to state-of-the-art hardware intrinsics. Given that TLX provides a Triton-native API for features like TMA, WS, CLC, 2-CTA, etc., once the performance is maximized in the standalone TLX kernel, integrating those wins into the PT2 stack through torchTLX requires a fairly small amount of additional work.

Second, it scales better than manual agentic kernel authoring. There is growing interest across the industry in agentic kernel authoring at scale. We believe making the PT2 stack natively aware of hardware architecture features might be a more scalable path. Once the plumbing is in place, every new kernel and fusion pattern benefits automatically.

## Knob

`TORCHINDUCTOR_TLX_MODE` (unset by default)
- unset / any other value - TLX not considered (standard inductor behavior; the config value is `None`)
- allow - TLX added to candidates, competes via autotuning
- force - TLX templates enabled + forced epilogue fusion

Only `allow` and `force` engage TLX; every other value (including an unset env var or a legacy `default`) maps to `None`, leaving TLX off. TLX is additionally a no-op unless the active Triton is the fbtriton fork.
