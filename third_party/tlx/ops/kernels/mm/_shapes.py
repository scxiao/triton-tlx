"""Shapes for ``tlx.ops.mm`` on Blackwell -- the single source of truth.

Both suites import this list:

* correctness -- ``python/test/unit/tlx_ops/test_mm.py``
* performance -- ``python/test/tlx_benchmark/bench_mm.py``

Sharing is deliberate, and the invariant it buys is worth more than the
convenience: a shape commented out for a correctness bug cannot stay
benchmarkable. Benchmarking a path that returns wrong answers produces a
number that looks like signal and is not.

Entries are ``[M, N, K, a_row_major, b_row_major]``. Layout belongs in the
entry rather than in a separate axis because a column-major operand is a
different code path AND moves the TMA 16-byte stride constraint to a different
dimension: row-major A constrains K, column-major A constrains M. dtype is a
separate parametrize axis in each suite.

FIXED (split-K remainder tile): ``[1000, 1000, 1024]`` and ``[64, 4096, 4096]``
were disabled here for a split-K bug -- wrong results when M was not a multiple
of BLOCK_SIZE_M -- and are now RE-ENABLED. Fixed upstream by #3401, verified on
this rebase: both are 0.0% wrong, as is the smaller repro ``[4160, 512, 512]``
(SPLIT_K=2, M % 256 == 64), which measured 4.0% wrong before. They stay in the
list as the regression test for that fix.

TODO(NUM_CTAS=2 multi-N-tile): ``[1000000, 512, 512]`` is commented out below
because it FAILS correctness. It is a **different** bug from the split-K one
above -- this one has ``SPLIT_K=1`` -- and it STILL REPRODUCES after #3401.

Whenever the heuristic picks ``NUM_CTAS=2`` and the grid has more than one
N-tile, 49.9% of output elements are wrong -- almost exactly one CTA of each
pair. Measured at fp16, comparing against ``torch.matmul``:

    999936  x 512  x 512   BM=256 BN=128 NUM_CTAS=2  ->  49.9% wrong
    999936  x 1024 x 512   BM=256 BN=128 NUM_CTAS=2  ->  49.9% wrong
    999936  x 2048 x 512   BM=256 BN=128 NUM_CTAS=2  ->  49.9% wrong
    65536   x 512  x 512   BM=256 BN=128 NUM_CTAS=2  ->  49.9% wrong
    65536   x 512  x 1024  BM=256 BN=256 NUM_CTAS=2  ->  49.9% wrong
    999936  x 512  x 1024  BM=256 BN=256 NUM_CTAS=2  ->  49.9% wrong
    131072  x 256  x 512   BM=256 BN=256 NUM_CTAS=2  ->   0.0% wrong

The last row is the control and identifies the trigger: N == BN there, so
``num_pid_n == 1``. Every failing row has more than one N-tile. Not a
remainder-tile problem -- 999936 is an exact multiple of both 256 and 512.

Reachable in production: the heuristic selects ``NUM_CTAS=2`` for ordinary
large-M shapes. Worse, autotuning cannot save you, because it ranks configs by
speed without checking their results.

Pre-existing, not a promotion artifact: the identical 49.9% reproduces through
the original tutorial entry point,
``blackwell_gemm_ws.matmul(a, b, config=get_heuristic_config(M, N, K, num_sms))``.
Not yet filed. Status here is BYPASSED, not fixed -- the shape is commented out
so a wrong-answer path cannot be benchmarked, per this project's rule of never
xfailing or loosening to go green.
