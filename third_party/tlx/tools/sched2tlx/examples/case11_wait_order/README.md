# case11_wait_order — schedule-draw order-sensitivity fixture

A minimal synthetic kernel that isolates one scheduling degree of freedom:
the position of a deferrable async-result read inside a warp group's
in-order instruction stream. Per loop iteration:

```
s1 = x_i @ w1^T          # MMA_A -> TMEM; its read feeds the exp2 chain
s2 = y_i @ w2^T          # MMA_B -> TMEM; its read feeds ONLY the combine
p  = exp2(s1 * scale)    # long SFU chain
z  = (p - s2) -> fp16    # combine + trunc
acc += z @ v             # MMA_C, loop-carried accumulator
```

The dependences admit two order families for `read(s2)`: coalesced with
`read(s1)` before the chain, or deferred until just before the combine.
Both families are model-equivalent (same II, same objective value, same
partition feasibility), yet they emit different in-order streams. On
case4 FA-bwd the same axis measured a 14% spread (292.8 vs 269.6 vs
255.8 TF at identical II/partition/objective, 2026-07-21 draw
calibration); this case distills that mechanism to 6 loop ops so draw
experiments can be run under control.

| file | role |
|---|---|
| `wait_order_nows.py` | source kernel + torch reference; dump command in its docstring |
| `wait_order_pre_modulo.ttgir` | modulo-pass input extracted from the MLIR dump |
| `ddg.json` / `schedule_graph.json` | pass dumps (`TRITON_MODULO_DUMP_DDG` / `_SCHEDULE`) |
| `generated.py` | sched2tlx emit of the committed schedule graph |
| `run_generated.py` | correctness vs torch (three shapes) |
| `bench_spec.py` | perf-harness spec (no handwritten reference) |

The committed dumps are generated with
`TRITON_USE_MODULO_SCHEDULE=exhaustive`. The schedule keeps `II=825`, and
every dependence satisfies the modulo constraint. The two TMEM recycle
recurrences are signal-only barriers (`paired_buffer_id=null`,
`expect_bytes=0`).

## Fixture invariants

- `s1`/`s2` remain [128, 64] fp32 to preserve the calibrated workload. Their
  reader-to-producer recurrences carry only `!ttg.async.token`; treating result
  0 of `tmem_load` as the carried value would invent two 32 KiB SMEM channels
  and incorrectly change partition feasibility.
- `tl.trans(w1)` / `tl.trans(w2)` must stay hoisted OUTSIDE the loop.
  Written inside the loop, the resident tiles' loop-invariant
  `local_alloc`/`memdesc_trans` nodes stay in the scheduled loop body and
  the emitted kernel deadlocks (reproduced on both the auto 7-WG split
  and a hand-merged 6-WG partition; hoisting removes the hang).
