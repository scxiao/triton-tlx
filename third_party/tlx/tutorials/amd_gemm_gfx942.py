"""TLX GEMM tutorial for AMD MI300X (gfx942 / CDNA3).

Every other AMD GEMM tutorial here targets gfx950 (CDNA4) and stages operands
with *direct-to-LDS* copies. On CDNA3 the right choice is the register-staged
path instead:

    global --tl.load--> VGPR --tlx.local_store--> LDS --tlx.local_load--> MFMA

What is left to tune, and what this kernel does:

* **Size the ring to the 64 KB CDNA3 LDS budget**, not CDNA4's 160 KB. The gfx950
  kernels' 256x256 tile with 64-deep K and two buffers wants ~128 KB and cannot
  be made to fit; even 256x128x64 needs 96 KB. ``lds_bytes`` computes the
  footprint and ``_prune_configs`` drops anything over budget before it is
  compiled.
* **Remap program ids across the 8 XCDs.** MI300X dispatches consecutive
  workgroups round-robin over the chiplets, which scatters tiles that should be
  sharing B columns in one L2. Measured, this is **neutral** here -- 0.86x aten
  with the remap vs 0.87x without at 4096^3 and 0.79x vs 0.79x at 8192^3, i.e.
  inside the noise -- because the GROUP_M swizzle already captures that reuse.
  It is kept as the standard MI300X grid transform; set ``NUM_XCDS=1`` in
  ``_configs()`` to A/B it.
* **Autotune the tile and the LDS ring depth per (M, N, K).** With 304 CUs no single tile serves both
  ends: a 1024^2 output decomposes into only 16 tiles of 256x256 and leaves the
  chip idle (0.35x aten), while the 64x64 tile that wins there collapses to
  0.54x at 4096^3. Picking per shape is the single largest effect in the whole
  kernel, and it is worth ~1.15x vs 0.35x at 1024^3. NUM_BUFFERS spans 1..3, so
  a single-buffered ring -- what ``amd_gemm_pipelined`` is fixed at -- is one
  point in the same search space rather than a separate kernel.
  ``_prune_configs`` drops tiles that overflow the LDS budget or outrun K
  before they are compiled.
* ``matrix_instr_nonkdim=16`` -- gfx942 fp16 MFMA is ``16x16x16`` / ``32x32x8``,
  half the K of CDNA4's ``16x16x32`` / ``32x32x16``.

Exposes ``matmul`` for the correctness suite (``testing/test_correctness.py``) and
the perf script (``testing/test_amd_gemm_gfx942_perf.py``, which compares against
aten).

    Deliberately small: MI300X has 304 CUs, so the useful range runs from a
    64x64 tile (enough workgroups to fill the chip on a 1024^2 output, which
    only decomposes into 16 tiles of 256x256) up to 256x256 (which needs a
    4096^2 output before it saturates). BLOCK_K is mostly 32 because the 64 KB
    CDNA3 LDS budget will not hold a deep K tile at the wide end -- 256x256x64
    would want 128 KB. `_prune_configs` drops whatever does not fit.

    NUM_BUFFERS spans 1..3, so the single-buffered ring is in the search space
    as the degenerate case rather than as a separate kernel. Every iteration
    reads and refills the same buffer (`buf = k % NUM_BUFFERS`), so depth only
    controls whether the *next* iteration touches a different buffer and can
    therefore issue its LDS read without waiting on this iteration's
    write-after-read barrier.

    Depth 1 turns out to win most shapes -- 8 of the 12 shape/dtype cases in the
    perf script, including both 8192^3 and both rectangular ones -- with depth 2
    taking 2048^3 and (fp16) 4096^3. So the extra buffer is not the lever it
    looks like: it costs LDS linearly, and on a 64 KB budget that LDS is often
    better spent on a wider tile. Note this also means depth is *not* what
    separates this kernel from `amd_gemm_pipelined`, whose configs are all
    NUM_STAGES=2 (NUM_BUFFERS=1) -- the difference is the tile space, which
    there is sized for a 160 KB-LDS part (128x128x128, 256x256x64) and mostly
    misfits CDNA3.
